That means that irregular bodies can have a longer chord in some directions, hence the mean radius averages out.\nIn the asteroid belt alone there are estimated to be between 1.1 and 1.9 million objects with a radius *above* 0.5 km,[244] many of which are in the range 0.5–1.0 km. Countless more have a radius *below* 0.5 km.\nVery few objects in this size range have been explored or even imaged. The exceptions are objects that have been visited by a probe, or have passed close enough to Earth to be imaged. Radius is by mean geometric radius. Number of digits not an endorsement of significant figures. Mass scale shifts from × 1015 to 109 kg, which is equivalent to one billion kg or 1012 grams (Teragram – Tg).\nCurrently most of the objects of mass between 109 kg to 1012 kg (less than 1000 teragrams (Tg)) listed here are near-Earth asteroids (NEAs).

These lists can be sorted according to an object's radius and mass and, for the most massive objects, volume, density, and surface gravity, if these values are available.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe following objects have a mean radius of at least 400 km. It was once expected that any icy body larger than approximately 200 km in radius was likely to be in hydrostatic equilibrium (HE).[7] However, Ceres (r = 470 km) is the smallest body for which detailed measurements are consistent with hydrostatic equilibrium,[8] whereas Iapetus (r = 735 km) is the largest icy body that has been found to not be in hydrostatic equilibrium.[9] The known icy moons in this range are all ellipsoidal (except Proteus), but trans-Neptunian objects up to 450–500 km radius may be quite porous.[10]\n\n\nFor simplicity and comparative purposes, the values are manually calculated assuming that the bodies are all spheres. The size of solid bodies does not include an object's atmosphere. For example, Titan looks bigger than Ganymede, but its solid body is smaller. For the giant planets, the \"radius\" is defined as the distance from the center at which the atmosphere reaches 1 bar of atmospheric pressure.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe sizes and masses of many of the moons of Jupiter and Saturn are fairly well known due to numerous observations and interactions of the *Galileo* and *Cassini* orbiters; however, many of the moons with a radius less than ~100 km, such as Jupiter's Himalia, have far less certain masses.[5] Further out from Saturn, the sizes and masses of objects are less clear. There has not yet been an orbiter around Uranus or Neptune for long-term study of their moons. For the small outer irregular moons of Uranus, such as Sycorax, which were not discovered by the *Voyager 2* flyby, even different NASA web pages, such as the National Space Science Data Center[6] and JPL Solar System Dynamics,[5] give somewhat contradictory size and albedo estimates depending on which research paper is being cited.\n\n\nThere are uncertainties in the figures for mass and radius, and irregularities in the shape and density, with accuracy often depending on how close the object is to Earth or whether it has been visited by a probe.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThis list contains a selection of objects estimated to be between 100 and 199 km in radius (200 and 399 km in diameter). The largest of these may have a hydrostatic-equilibrium shape, but most are irregular. Most of the trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) listed with a radius smaller than 200 km have \"*assumed sizes* based on a *generic* albedo of 0.09\" since they are too far away to directly measure their sizes with existing instruments. Mass switches from 1021 kg to 1018 kg (Zg). Main-belt asteroids have orbital elements constrained by (2.0 AU < a < 3.2 AU; q > 1.666 AU) according to JPL Solar System Dynamics (JPLSSD).[98] Many TNOs are omitted from this list as their sizes are poorly known.[58]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSolar System objects more massive than 1021 kilograms are known or expected to be approximately spherical. Astronomical bodies relax into rounded shapes (spheroids), achieving hydrostatic equilibrium, when their own gravity is sufficient to overcome the structural strength of their material. It was believed that the cutoff for round objects is somewhere between 100 km and 200 km in radius if they have a large amount of ice in their makeup;[1] however, later studies revealed that icy satellites as large as Iapetus (1,470 kilometers in diameter) are not in hydrostatic equilibrium at this time,[2] and a 2019 assessment suggests that many TNOs in the size range of 400–1,000 kilometers may not even be fully solid bodies, much less gravitationally rounded.[3] Objects that are ellipsoids due to their own gravity are here generally referred to as being \"round\", whether or not they are actually in equilibrium today, while objects that are clearly not ellipsoidal are referred to as being \"irregular.\"\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThese lists contain the Sun, the planets, dwarf planets, many of the larger small Solar System bodies (which includes the asteroids), all named natural satellites, and a number of smaller objects of historical or scientific interest, such as comets and near-Earth objects.\n\n\nMany trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) have been discovered; in many cases their positions in this list are approximate, as there is frequently a large uncertainty in their estimated diameters due to their distance from Earth.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Radius estimated using equatorial radius and assuming body is spherical\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Radius has been determined by various methods, such as optical (Hubble), thermal (Spitzer), or direct imaging via spacecraft\n3. **^** Calculated in Wolfram Alpha using semi axes of 1050 × 840 × 537 (Ellipsoid volume: 1.98395×10^9 km3)\n4. **^** Best fit, assuming Haumea is in hydrostatic equilibrium\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Radius estimated by using three radii and assuming body is spheroid\n6. **^** The mass estimate is based on the assumed density of 1.2 g/cm3, and a volume of 3.5 ×106 km3 obtained from a detailed shape model in Stooke (1994).[118]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Iris7 | ![](image) | 100±5 | 13.5±2.3 | belt asteroid type S | [84] |\n| Legend:\ncentaur – asteroids orbiting between the outer planets\nJupiter trojan – asteroids located in Jupiter's L4 and L5 Lagrange points |\n\n\n### From 50 to 99 km[edit]\n\n\nThis list contains a selection of objects 50 and 99 km in radius (100 km to 199 km in average diameter). The listed objects currently include most objects in the asteroid belt and moons of the giant planets in this size range, but many newly discovered objects in the outer Solar System are missing, such as those included in the following reference.[58] Asteroid spectral types are mostly Tholen, but some might be SMASS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAll imaged icy moons with radii greater than 200 km except Proteus are clearly round, although those under 400 km that have had their shapes carefully measured are not in hydrostatic equilibrium.[57] The known densities of TNOs in this size range are remarkably low (1–1.2 g/cm3), implying that the objects retain significant internal porosity from their formation and were never gravitationally compressed into fully solid bodies.[10]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSpheroidal bodies typically have some polar flattening due to the centrifugal force from their rotation, and can sometimes even have quite different equatorial diameters (scalene ellipsoids such as Haumea). Unlike bodies such as Haumea, the irregular bodies have a significantly non-ellipsoidal profile, often with sharp edges.\n\n\nThere can be difficulty in determining the diameter (within a factor of about 2) for typical objects beyond Saturn. (See 2060 Chiron as an example) For TNOs there is some confidence in the diameters, but for non-binary TNOs there is no real confidence in the masses/densities. Many TNOs are often just assumed to have Pluto's density of 2.0 g/cm3, but it is just as likely that they have a comet-like density of only 0.5 g/cm3.[4]\n\n\nFor example, if a TNO is incorrectly assumed to have a mass of 3.59×1020 kg based on a radius of 350 km with a density of 2 g/cm3 but is later discovered to have a radius of only 175 km with a density of 0.5 g/cm3, its true mass would be only 1.12×1019 kg.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| PsamatheNeptune X | ![](image) | ≈ 20 |  | moon of Neptune\n | [5] |\n\n\n### From 1 to 19 km[edit]\n\n\nThis list contains some examples of Solar System objects between 1 and 19 km in radius.

{"id":"b31e39b56af586a2","answer":"The Sumerian King List is an ancient literary composition that lists the kings of Sumer from Sumerian civilization until the Isin dynasty. The list is divided into several sections, with the first section listing eight kings who ruled before the flood. These kings are said to have reigned for incredibly long periods, ranging from 43,200 to 28,800 years. After the flood, the kingship is said to have descended from heaven and been taken to various cities, including Kish, Uruk, Ur, and Isin.\n\nThe list is not considered a reliable historical source for the early dynastic period of Mesopotamia due to the exaggerated reign lengths and the fact that many of the rulers listed are not attested in contemporary inscriptions. However, it becomes more reliable from the Akkadian period onwards, as the reign lengths are more reasonable and many of the kings listed are attested in other sources.\n\nThe list is thought to have been created and redacted during the late third and early second millennia BC to legitimize the claims to power of various city-states and kingdoms in southern Mesopotamia. It is not a single text, but rather a literary composition of which different versions existed through time, with sections missing, arranged in a different order, and names, reigns, and details on kings varying or absent.\n\nIn summary, the Sumerian King List is not a reliable source for the early dynastic period of Mesopotamia, but it does provide valuable insights into the political history and ideology of the region during the late third and early second millennia BC."}

The Polaris seat converts into a 6' 6\" flatbed, and boasts multiple storage areas, mood lighting, multiple charging ports, lumbar support, and improved dining and amenity services.[72]\n\n\nPolaris seats can be found on all Boeing 767s, Boeing 777-300ERs, and Boeing 787 Dreamliners, and internationally configured Boeing 777-200ERs. On these aircraft, the cabins are configured to provide aisle access to every passenger, with 767s featuring a 1-1-1 seat configuration while 777s and 787s have a 1-2-1 seat configuration. Boeing 757-200s feature United's older BusinessFirst seats (which United inherited from Continental) with Polaris branding, with a 2-2 seat configuration.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA request to divert to Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico, was denied due to the security risks created by the presence of the President of Portugal Mário Soares, Argentinian foreign minister Guido di Tella and their security details on the flight. The disruptive passenger was arrested by the FBI after landing in New York and charged with interfering with a flight crew and threatening a flight attendant. He later pleaded guilty to the latter charge and was fined $5,000 (having previously agreed to reimburse the airline for its cleanup costs and all the other passengers their airfare, which amounted to nearly $50,000) and given two years' probation[192] The incident was later dubbed the worst ever case of air rage.[193][194]\n\n\n\n### 2017 passenger removal[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2017 United Express passenger removal\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn February 2021, United Airlines was fined $49 million by the Department of Justice on charges of fraud on postal service contracts for transportation of international mail. According to investigators, between 2012 and 2015 United submitted delivery scan data to make it appear that United and its partner airlines complied with International Commercial Air requirements with accurate delivery times when in fact they were automated delivery scans with aspirational delivery time.

After the merger of United and Continental in October 2010, the slogan changed to \"Let's fly together\" until September 2013,[119] when United announced a return of the \"Fly the Friendly Skies\" slogan in an ad campaign to start the following day.[120] The resurrected slogan would be accompanied by the 1924 George Gershwin song \"Rhapsody in Blue\" as its theme song, and a voiceover provided by Matt Damon.[119]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn September 22, 2012, United became the first American airline to take delivery of Boeing 787 aircraft.[62] United is also the North American launch customer for the Boeing 787-9[63] and 787-10 aircraft,[64] which are stretched versions of the base 787-8 model, delivered at launch.\n\n\nIn May 2018, United planned to replace its 51 Boeing 767s in a deal potentially worth $14 billion at list prices, and was in talks with both Airbus and Boeing, for their A330neo and 787.[65]\nUnited operates 128 757s and 767s (77 B757s and 51 B767s), the second-largest combined fleet after Delta Air Lines with 206 (127 757s and 79 767s).

Clean the World provides hygiene education and soap to promote handwashing, which helps prevent hygiene-related deaths. During the first year of this partnership, United expected to divert 60,000 pounds (27,200 kg) of material that otherwise would have gone to landfills.[131]\n\n\nIn 2017 United started a partnership with Audubon International to protect raptors—including hawks, ospreys and owls—in and around New York-area airports and resettle the birds-of-prey at suitable golf course habitats where the species are more likely to thrive.[132]\n\n\n\n### Worker relations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn late 2006, Continental Airlines and United began merger discussions,[27][28] which concluded successfully in 2010.[29] The carriers planned to begin merging their operations in 2011.[30] The merged airline began operating under a single air operator's certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration on November 30, 2011.[31] On March 3, 2012, United and Continental merged their passenger service systems, frequent-flier programs, and websites, which virtually eliminated the Continental brand with the exception of its logo.[32] On June 27, 2019, the parent company's name changed from United Continental Holdings to United Airlines Holdings.[33]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUnited had licensed its theme song, \"Rhapsody in Blue\", from Gershwin's estate for US$500,000 (equivalent to $2,571,345 in 2022) in 1976.[121] \"Rhapsody\" would have entered the public domain in 2000, but the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998 extended its copyright another 20 years until January 1, 2020, when it officially entered on the Public Domain.[122][123]\nUnited announced that it would continue to use \"Rhapsody in Blue\" as its theme song following the merger with Continental.[124]\n\n\n\n### Environmental initiatives[edit]\n\n\nBecause over 98 percent of United's greenhouse gas emissions are from jet fuel, its environmental strategy has focused on operational fuel efficiency initiatives and investments in sustainably produced, low-carbon alternative fuels.[125]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Chicago–O'Hare – United's hub for the Midwest and largest hub overall.

The clause acts to perpetuate United having a Boeing-skewed fleet.[61]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfterwards, United's then-chief executive officer, Oscar Munoz, described Dao as \"disruptive and belligerent\", apologized for \"re-accommodating\" the paying customers, and defended and praised staff for \"following established procedures\". He was widely criticized as \"tone-deaf\".[198] Munoz later issued a second statement calling what happened a \"truly horrific event\" and accepting \"full responsibility\" for it.[199] After a lawsuit, Dao reached an undisclosed settlement with United and airport police. In the aftermath, United's board of directors decided that Munoz would not become its chairman and that executive compensation would be tied to customer satisfaction.[200] Following this incident, passenger complaints increased by 70 percent.[201]\n\n\n\n### Summer 2023 operational crisis[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Founded | April 6, 1926; 97 years ago (1926-04-06) (as Varney Air Lines in Boise, Idaho)[1] |\n| Commenced operations | March 28, 1931; 92 years ago (1931-03-28)[2] |\n| AOC # | CALA014A[3] |\n| Hubs | * Chicago–O'Hare\n* Denver\n* Guam\n* Houston–Intercontinental\n* Los Angeles\n* Newark\n* San Francisco\n* Washington–Dulles\n |\n| Frequent-flyer program | MileagePlus |\n| Alliance | Star Alliance |\n| Fleet size | 922[4] |\n| Destinations | 363[5] |\n| Parent company | United Airlines Holdings |\n| ISIN | US9100471096 |\n| Headquarters | Willis Tower, Chicago, Illinois U.S. |\n| Key people | * Scott Kirby (CEO)[6]\n* Edward Philip (Chairman)[7]\n* Brett Hart (President)[8]\n |\n| Founder | Walter Varney |\n| Employees | 92,795 (2022)[9] |\n| Website | Official website |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nLegacy air carriers of the United States\n |\n| --- |\n| Air carriers that operated hub-and-spoke, interstate route networks at the time of the 1978 Airline Deregulation Act\n |\n| Current legacy carriers | * Alaska Airlines\n* American Airlines\n* Delta Air Lines\n* Hawaiian Airlines\n* United Airlines\n |\n| Defunct legacy carriers | * Aloha Airlines\n* Braniff International Airways\n* Continental Airlines\n* Eastern Air Lines\n* Frontier Airlines\n* Hughes Airwest\n* National Airlines\n* North Central Airlines\n* Northwest Airlines\n* Ozark Air Lines\n* Pan Am\n* Piedmont Airlines\n* Southern Airways\n* Texas International Airlines\n* Trans World Airlines\n* US Airways\n* Western Airlines\n |\n| * List of airlines of the United States\n* List of defunct airlines of the United States\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  | 2015\n | 2016\n | 2017\n | 2018\n | 2019\n | 2020\n | 2021\n | 2022\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Net income (US$ m)\n | 7,340\n | 2,263\n | 2,131\n | 2,122\n | 3,009\n | −7,069 | −1,964 | **737** |\n| Number of employees\n | 84,000\n | 88,000\n | 89,800\n | 92,000\n | 95,900\n | 74,400\n | 84,100\n | **92,800** |\n| Number of passengers (m)\n | 140\n | 143\n | 148\n | 158\n | 162\n | 57.7\n | 104\n | **144** |\n| Passenger load factor (%)\n | 83.4\n | 82.9\n | 82.4\n | 83.6\n | 84.0\n | 60.2\n | 72.2\n | **83.4** |\n| Fleet size (mainline)\n | 715\n | 737\n | 744\n | 770\n | 777\n | 812\n | 826\n | **868** |\n| References | [96] | [97] | [98] | [99] | [100] | [101] | [102] | [103] |\n\n\n### Ownership and structure[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAmerican airline\n\nThis article is about the airline based in the United States.

Those born during the World wars are marked in dark\nDemographic features of the population of Italy include population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects.\n\n\nAt the beginning of 2022, Italy had an estimated population of 58,9 million. Its population density, at 197 inhabitants per square kilometre (510/sq mi), is higher than that of most Western European countries. However, the distribution of the population is widely uneven; the most densely populated areas are the Po Valley (which contains about a third of the country's population) in northern Italy and the metropolitan areas of Rome and Naples in central and southern Italy, while other vast areas are very sparsely populated, like the plateaus of Basilicata, the Alps and Apennines highlands, and the island of Sardinia.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUNESCO and other authorities recognize a number of other languages which are not legally protected by Italian government: Piedmontese, Venetian, Ligurian, Lombard, Emilian-Romagnolo, Neapolitan and Sicilian.\n\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Italy\n\nReligion in Italy according to the Eurobarometer survey, 2021[98]\n\n\n\nCatholicism (79.2%)\nEastern Orthodoxy (3.5%)\nProtestantism (0.3%)\nOther Christian (1.4%)\nIslam (1.0%)\nBuddhism (0.4%)\nHinduism/Sikhism (0.3%)\nJudaism (0.1%)\nOther (1.4%)\nAgnosticism (7.5%)\nAtheism (4.1%)\nUndeclared (1.0%)\n\nRoman Catholicism is by far the largest religion in the country, although the Catholic Church is no longer officially the state religion. In 2006, 87.8% of Italy's population self-identified as Roman Catholic,[99] although only about one-third of these described themselves as active members (36.8%). In 2016, 71.1% of *Italian citizens* self-identified as Roman Catholic.[100] This increased again to 78% in 2018.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nItaly is in fact one of the most linguistically diverse countries in Europe,[91] as there are not only varieties of Italian specific to each cultural region, but also distinct regional and minority languages. The establishment of the national education system has led to the emergence of the former and a decrease in the use of the latter. The spread of Italian was further expanded in the 1950s and 1960s, because of the economic growth and the rise of mass media and television, with the state broadcaster (RAI) setting a colloquial variety of Italian to which the population would be exposed.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nItaly has a rich Catholic culture, especially as numerous Catholic saints, martyrs and popes were Italian themselves. Roman Catholic art in Italy especially flourished during the Middle Ages, Renaissance and Baroque periods, with numerous Italian artists, such as Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Caravaggio, Fra Angelico, Gian Lorenzo Bernini, Sandro Botticelli, Tintoretto, Titian and Giotto. Roman Catholic architecture in Italy is equally as rich and impressive, with churches, basilicas and cathedrals such as St Peter's Basilica, Florence Cathedral and St Mark's Basilica. Roman Catholicism is the largest religion and denomination in Italy, with around 71.1% of Italians considering themselves Catholic. Italy is also home to the greatest number of cardinals in the world,[103] and is the country with the greatest number of Roman Catholic churches per capita.[104]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2021, Istat estimated that 5,171,894 foreign citizens lived in Italy, representing about 8.7% of the total population.[32] These figures do not include naturalized foreign-born residents (121,457 foreigners acquired Italian citizenship in 2021)[65] as well as illegal immigrants, the so-called *clandestini*, whose numbers, difficult to determine, are thought to be at least 670,000.[66] Romanians made up the largest community in the country (1,145,718; around 10% of them being ethnic Romani people[67]), followed by Albanians (441,027) and Moroccans (422,980).[68][69]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHigh fertility and birth rates persisted until the 1970s, after which they started to dramatically decline, leading to rapid population aging. At the end of the late 2000s, one in five Italians were over 65 years old.[4] Italy has experienced a short growth in birth rates.[5] The total fertility rate temporarily rose from an all-time low of 1.18 children per woman in 1995 to 1.46 in 2010.[6] Since then, fertility rates continued to drop, to reach a low of 1.24 in 2020.\n\n\nSince the revision of the Lateran Treaty in 1984, Italy has no official religion, although it continues to recognize the role the Catholic Church plays in Italian society. In 2017, 78% of the population identified as Catholic, 15% as non-believers or atheists, 2% as other Christians and 6% adhered to other religions.[7]\n\n\n\n## Contents\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe fourth largest, but the fastest growing, community of foreign residents in Italy was represented by the Chinese.[70] The majority of Chinese living in Italy are from the city of Wenzhou in the province of Zhejiang.[71] Breaking down the foreign-born population by continent, in 2020 the figures were as follows: Europe (54%), Africa (22%), Asia (16%), the Americas (8%) and Oceania (0.06%). The distribution of immigrants is largely uneven in Italy: 83% of immigrants live in the northern and central parts of the country (the most economically developed areas), while only 17% live in the southern half of the peninsula.[72]\n\n\n\nNet migration rate\n\n3.21 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2021 est.)

Its development was also influenced by the Germanic languages of the post-Roman invaders. When Italy unified in 1861, only 3% of the population spoke Italian,[89] even though an estimated 90% of Italians speak Italian as their L1 nowadays.[90]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn Sardinia, the Sardinian language has been the language traditionally spoken and is often regarded by linguists as constituting its own branch of Romance;[96] in the 1990s, Sardinian has been recognized as \"having equal dignity\" with Italian,[97] the introduction of which to the island officially started under the rule of the House of Savoy in the 18th century.\n\n\nIn these regions, official documents are either bilingual (trilingual in Ladin communities) in the co-official language(s) by default, or available as such upon request. Traffic signs are also multilingual, except in the Valle d'Aosta where French toponyms are generally used, with the exception of Aosta itself, which has retained its Latin form in Italian as well as English. Attempts to Italianize them, especially during the Fascist period, have been formally abandoned. Education is possible in minority languages where such schools are operating.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe population of the country almost doubled during the twentieth century, but the pattern of growth was extremely uneven due to large-scale internal migration from the rural South to the industrial cities of the North, a phenomenon which happened as a consequence of the Italian economic miracle of the 1950–1960s. In addition, after centuries of net emigration, from the 1980s Italy has experienced large-scale immigration for the first time in modern history. Italian government data, in its annual report for 2019, estimated the amount of foreign nationals residing within Italy, including immigrants, to be at approximately 5.234 million people.[3] Due to such large-scale immigration to the country, particularly from the early 2000s to 2014, the population peaked at 60.79 million. Since then, decreasing migration, a continuously falling birth rate, and continuous aging have led to a sharp decrease in the Italian population.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSince the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, and more recently, the 2004 and 2007 enlargements of the European Union, Italy received growing flows of migrants from the former socialist countries of Eastern Europe (especially Romania, Albania, Ukraine and Poland).[61] The second most important area of immigration to Italy has always been the neighboring North Africa (especially Morocco, Egypt, Tunisia and Algeria).[62] Furthermore, in recent years, growing migration fluxes from the Far East (notably, China[63] and the Philippines) and Latin America (Ecuador, Peru) have been recorded.\n\n\nItaly does not collect data on ethnicity or race of the country, but does collect data on nationality of its residents.[64]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*0-14 years:* 0–14 years: 13.45% (male 4,292,431/female 4,097,732)\n*15-24 years:* 9.61% (male 3,005,402/female 2,989,764)\n*25-54 years:* 40.86% (male 12,577,764/female 12,921,614)\n*55-64 years:* 14% (male 4,243,735/female 4,493,581)\n*65 years and over:* 22.08% (male 5,949,560/female 7,831,076) (2020 est.\n**Median age**\n\n\n\n\ntotal: 46.5 years.

Italy has seen many influential Italian-Jews, such as prime minister Luigi Luzzatti, who took office in 1910, Ernesto Nathan served as mayor of Rome from 1907 to 1913 and Shabbethai Donnolo (died 982). During the Holocaust, Italy took in many Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany. However, with the creation of the Nazi-backed puppet Italian Social Republic, about 15% of 48,000 Italian Jews were killed. This, together with the emigration that preceded and followed the Second World War, has left only a small community of around 45,000 Jews in Italy today.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFrom its unification in 1861 to the Italian economic miracle of the 1950s and 1960s, Italy has been a country of mass emigration. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDue to immigration from around the world, there has been an increase in non-Christian religions. As of 2009, there were 1.0 million Muslims in Italy[111] forming 1.6 percent of population; independent estimates put the Islamic population in Italy anywhere from 0.8 million[112] to 1.5 million.[113] 50,000 Italian Muslims hold Italian citizenship.\n\n\nThere are more than 200,000 followers of faiths originating in the Indian subcontinent, including some 70,000 Sikhs with 22 gurdwaras across the country,[114] 70,000 Hindus, and 50,000 Buddhists.[115] There were an estimated 4,900 Bahá'ís in Italy in 2005.[116]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\n**Literacy**\n\n\n\n\n*definition:* age 15 and over can read and write\ntotal population: 99.2%\nmale: 99.4%\nfemale: 99% (2018 est.)\n**School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)**\n\n\n\n\ntotal: 16 years\nmale: 16 years\nfemale: 17 years (2018)\n## Genetics and ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Genetic history of Italy\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs a way to distance itself from the Italianization policies promoted because of nationalism, Italy recognized twelve languages as the Country's \"historical linguistic minorities\",[92] which are promoted alongside Italian in their respective territories. French is co-official in the Aosta Valley as the province's prestige variety, under which the more commonly spoken Franco-Provencal dialects have been historically roofed.[93] German has the same status in the province of South Tyrol as, in some parts of that province and in parts of the neighbouring Trentino, does Ladin.[94] Slovene[95] and Friulian are officially recognised in the provinces of Trieste, Gorizia and Udine in Venezia Giulia. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFrom January 2020 and December 2021 as a direct effect of COVID-19 pandemic and Deltacron hybrid variant, Italy has registered at least 178,000 excess deaths, a loss of about 1.4 years in the average life expectancy, a noticeable decrease in births rates and a marked decrease in immigration rates, the overall effect being a record natural population decline of 342,042 units in that year, the largest ever recorded since 1918 (at the time of World War I and Spanish flu pandemic).[32] In 2022, Italy's birth rate declined to its lowest level on record since 1861, with fewer then 400,000 births recorded that year.[33][34][35][36][37][38]\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Historic population of Italy\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nconstituting about 18% of the total Libyan population).[25]\n\n\n\n### After World War II[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Istrian Italians leave Pola in 1947 during the Istrian-Dalmatian exodus\nAfter Tito's annexation of Istria, Kvarner, most of the Julian March as well as the Dalmatian city of Zara following the Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947, up to 350,000 local ethnic Italians (Istrian Italians and Dalmatian Italians) left communist Yugoslavia (Istrian–Dalmatian exodus).[26][27] Furthermore, all of Libya's Italians were expelled after Muammar Gaddafi's takeover in 1970.[28]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMost Italians believe in God, or a form of a spiritual life force. According to a Eurobarometer Poll in 2005:[101] 74% of Italian citizens responded that 'they believe there is a God', 16% answered that 'they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force' and 6% answered that 'they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, God, or life force'. There are no data collected through census.\n\n\n\n### Christianity[edit]\n\n\nThe Italian Catholic Church is part of the global Roman Catholic Church, under the leadership of the Pope, curia in Rome, and the Conference of Italian Bishops. In addition to Italy, two other sovereign nations are included in Italian-based dioceses, San Marino and Vatican City. There are 225 dioceses in the Italian Catholic Church, see further in this article and in the article List of the Roman Catholic dioceses in Italy. Even though by law Vatican City is not part of Italy, it is in Rome, and along with Latin, Italian is the most spoken and second language of the Roman Curia.[102]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n105. **^** \"The Duomo of Florence | Tripleman\". tripleman.com.

The ancestors of Italians are mostly Indo-European speakers (Italic peoples such as Latins,  Umbrians, Samnites, Oscans, Sicels and Adriatic Veneti, as well as Celts, Iapygians and Greeks) and pre-Indo-European speakers (Etruscans, Ligures, Rhaetians and Camunni in mainland Italy, Sicani and Elymians in Sicily and the Nuragic people in Sardinia). During the imperial period of Ancient Rome, the city of Rome was also home to people from various regions throughout the Mediterranean basin, including Southern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.[118] Based on DNA analysis, there is evidence of ancient regional genetic substructure and continuity within modern Italy dating to the pre-Roman and Roman periods.[119][120][121][122]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Santa Maria del Fiore cathedral in Florence, which has the biggest brick dome in the world,[105][106] and is considered a masterpiece of Italian architecture.\nEven though the main Christian denomination in Italy is Roman Catholicism, there are some minorities of Protestant, Waldensian, Eastern Orthodox and other Christian churches.\n\n\nImmigration from Western, Central, and Eastern Africa at the beginning of the 21st century has increased the size of Baptist, Anglican, Pentecostal and Evangelical communities in Italy, while immigration from Eastern Europe has produced large Eastern Orthodox communities.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n123. **^** «It should be noted, then, that the Italians, though often described as a homogeneous people, are divided into several culturally, socially, and politically diverse groups throughout the peninsula.» Jeffrey Cole (edited by), *Ethnic Groups of Europe: An Encyclopedia*, Santa Barbara (California), ABC-CLIO, 2011, p.204\n124. **^** \"Italy - World Directory of Minorities & Indigenous Peoples\".\n\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Demographics of Italy.\n\n* Demographic page Archived 22 June 2017 at the Wayback Machine\n* Demographic Profile Italy Allianz Knowledge\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n62. **^** \"Migration from the Middle East and North Africa to Europe\" (PDF).

{"id":"0d70f358145e1f8d","answer":"The Eras Tour is Taylor Swift's sixth concert tour, which she described as a journey through all of her musical \"eras.\" The tour is her most expansive to date, with 151 shows across five continents. It is the highest-grossing tour ever by a woman and the second highest-grossing overall based on the first 56 North American shows alone.\n\nThe tour began on March 17, 2023, in Glendale, Arizona, and is scheduled to end on December 8, 2024, in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The tour features various supporting acts, including Paramore, Gayle, Beabadoobee, Muna, Gracie Abrams, Phoebe Bridgers, Owenn, Girl in Red, Haim, Sabrina Carpenter, and Louta.\n\nThe setlist for the tour is divided into 10 acts, each representing one of Swift's studio albums. The tour has had a significant cultural, economic, and political impact, with unprecedented demand, ticket sales, venue attendance records, and technical obstacles leading to price regulation and anti-scalping laws. The tour has also elevated economies, businesses, and tourism, dominated news cycles and social media, and received tributes from governments and organizations.\n\nTicketmaster, an official partner of the tour, was scrutinized for ineffective sales and alleged monopoly. Swift announced and released various works during the tour, including extended editions of Midnights, the re-recorded albums Speak Now (Taylor's Version) and 1989 (Taylor's Version), the music videos for \"Karma\" and \"I Can See You,\" and \"Cruel Summer\" as a single. An accompanying concert film was released to theaters worldwide on October 13, 2023, and became the highest-grossing concert film in history.\n\nHere are the five most recent concert tours by Taylor Swift, including the city where each tour started:\n\n1. The Eras Tour - Glendale, Arizona (March 17, 2023)\n2. Reputation Stadium Tour - Glendale, Arizona (May 8, 2018)\n3. 1989 World Tour - Tokyo, Japan (May 5, 2015)\n4. The Red Tour - Omaha, Nebraska (March 13, 2013)\n5. Speak Now World Tour - Singapore (February 9, 2011)"}
