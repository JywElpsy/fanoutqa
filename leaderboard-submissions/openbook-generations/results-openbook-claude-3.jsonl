However, the search query to find that specific information is not clear. There are a few key pieces of information missing to construct a good search query:\n\n1. The term \"indie rock bands\" is quite broad and subjective. It's not a clearly defined genre, so searching for that term directly may not yield great results. More specific genre terms or a list of representative bands would help narrow it down.\n\n2. Specifying only bands whose names start with 0-9 is very specific criteria that is unlikely to be captured succinctly in any Wikipedia article titles. An article may contain a list of bands in a table or the body text, but the title wouldn't reflect that level of detail.\n\n3. Limiting to only bands from the United States also makes it unlikely any single Wikipedia article would have that precise information in the title. Articles tend to be broader in scope.\n\nWithout being able to construct a sufficiently narrow and targeted search query, I don't think the Wikipedia search tool provided would be able to directly answer this question. More context would be needed from the human to identify specific search terms or example bands to look up.\n</thinking>\n\nI apologize, but I do not have enough information to determine exactly how many indie rock bands from the United States have names that start with a number from 0-9.

{"id":"5f4a3c15e2dc159a","answer":"<thinking>\nThe Wikipedia article on Frédéric Passy does not provide any explicit information about his marital status or how many times he was married. However, it does mention some details about his wife and children:\n\n\"In 1847, Passy married the wealthy Marie Blanche Sageret (1827–1900), the daughter of Jules Sageret and Marie Florence Irma Moricet. Their first son, Paul, was born in 1859. He became a famous linguist, known for founding the International Phonetic Association. Passy's progressive views on European culture were influential towards his parenting: his son Paul learnt four languages as a child, yet never attended school. Another son, Jean, was born in 1866: he also became a linguist and preceded his brother as Secretary of the IPA.\"\n\nIt also mentions a daughter:\n\n\"Passy and Sageret also had a daughter called Marie Louise, whose husband Louis André Paulian was in charge of the Chamber of Deputies's stenographic bureau.\"\n\nSo based on this, it appears Passy was married to Marie Blanche Sageret from 1847 until her death in 1900, and they had at least three children together - sons Paul and Jean, and daughter Marie Louise. \n\nThe article does not mention any other marriages or spouses besides Marie Blanche Sageret. While it's possible he remarried after her death in 1900, there are no indications of that in the biographical details provided.\n\nTherefore, while the article does not definitively state Passy was only married once, the fact that it only discusses one wife strongly suggests Marie Blanche Sageret was likely his sole spouse. Barring additional information to the contrary, it seems reasonable to conclude the co-recipient of the first Nobel Peace Prize was married one time based on what is presented in this Wikipedia entry. But more research would be needed to say that with absolute certainty.\n</thinking>\n\n<result>\n1\n</result>\n\n<result>\nIn summary:\n\nWilhelm Röntgen (Physics): Married 1 time to Anna Bertha Ludwig\nJacobus Henricus van 't Hoff (Chemistry): Likely married 1 time to Johanna Francina Mees, but not definitively stated\nEmil von"}

It also provides a table showing the minimum surface temperature is 820 °F (438 °C), the mean is 847 °F (453 °C), and the maximum is 900 °F (482 °C). Converting these Fahrenheit values to Kelvin gives a minimum of about 711 K, mean of 737 K, and maximum of 755 K.\n\nSo in summary, the surface temperature of Venus ranges from approximately 711-755 K, with a mean of 737 K. This information, along with the context provided about Venus's extreme greenhouse effect heating the surface, provides a satisfactory answer to the original question. No further searching is needed.\n</search_quality_reflection>\n\n<search_quality_score>5</search_quality_score>\n\n<result>\nAccording to Wikipedia, the surface temperature of Venus ranges from approximately 711 K to 755 K, with a mean temperature of 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F). \n\nMore specifically:\nMinimum surface temperature: 820 °F (438 °C) = 711 K\nMean surface temperature: 847 °F (453 °C) = 737 K \nMaximum surface temperature: 900 °F (482 °C) = 755 K\n\nVenus has the hottest surface of any planet in the solar system, even though Mercury is closer to the Sun. This is due to Venus's extremely dense atmosphere which is 96.5% carbon dioxide. The CO2 generates a powerful greenhouse effect that traps heat, resulting in the scorching surface temperatures.\n</result>"}

It states that T-Series was founded by Gulshan Kumar on July 11, 1983 in Delhi, India. So T-Series was founded in 1983.\n\nTo find the founding years of the other top brand channels:\n\nCocomelon - The article mentions Cocomelon is an American YouTube channel, but does not give a specific founding year. I would need to search further to try to find that information.\n\nSony Entertainment Television India - The article says this is a subsidiary of Sony Pictures Networks India, but does not give a founding year for the subsidiary specifically.

{"id":"463dc2d63102a4ea","answer":"<thinking>\nThe search results for \"OpenAI\" provide a lot of relevant information about the company, but do not directly answer the question about the licensing of their GPT models. Some key points from the search results:\n\n- OpenAI was founded as a non-profit in 2015 but transitioned to a \"capped-profit\" model in 2019 to attract more investment. \n- In 2019 they announced GPT-2 but initially did not release the full model publicly due to concerns about potential misuse. This suggests they do not fully open source their models.\n- In 2020 they announced an API to allow developers to access their AI models, including GPT-3, rather than open sourcing the models directly. The API allows them to maintain more control.\n- Microsoft invested $1 billion in OpenAI in 2019 and got an exclusive license to GPT-3 in 2020.\n\nSo in summary, it seems OpenAI does not openly license their GPT models, but rather makes them available in a limited way through APIs while retaining control. The full models are not open sourced. To directly confirm the licensing I would need to find where OpenAI officially states their licensing approach, but these search results provide strong clues that the models are proprietary rather than open. To fully answer the question I would tell the human that based on my searches, it appears OpenAI's GPT models are not openly licensed, but are made available in a limited way through APIs.

This suggests the model was not openly licensed.\n\n- In 2020, rather than open-sourcing their models, OpenAI released an API to allow limited access for developers to GPT-3 and other models.

{"id":"998901bf4f571891","answer":"<search_quality_reflection>\nThe Wikipedia article on the Romansh language provides a good amount of information to estimate the number of native Romansh speakers worldwide. Key details:\n\n- Romansh is spoken predominantly in the Swiss canton of Grisons. In the 2000 Swiss census, 35,095 people indicated Romansh as the language of \"best command\", with 27,038 of those living in Grisons. \n\n- In 2019, there were 40,074 Swiss residents who primarily spoke Romansh. In 2017, 28,698 inhabitants of Grisons (14.7% of the population) used it as their main language.\n\n- Romansh is divided into 5 regional written varieties: Sursilvan, Vallader, Putèr, Surmiran, and Sutsilvan. There is also a standardized variety called Rumantsch Grischun.\n\n- Outside of Grisons, Romansh is spoken by the \"Romansh diaspora\", people who have moved out of the traditional Romansh-speaking valleys. A significant number are found in the capital of Grisons, Chur, as well as in other Swiss cities.\n\nSo in summary, the native Romansh speaking population is heavily concentrated in the canton of Grisons in Switzerland and numbers around 40,000 as of recent estimates.

{"id":"b31e39b56af586a2","answer":"<thinking>\nThe search results provide a lot of relevant information to answer the question. Key points:\n\n- The earliest known cradles of civilization were in Mesopotamia, Ancient Egypt, the Indus Valley, and China. The article does not specify the exact cities that first had kings in these regions.\n\n- In Mesopotamia, the Sumerian city-states of Uruk, Ur, Kish and Eridu are mentioned as some of the earliest urban centers, dating back to around 4000-3100 BC. Kingship likely emerged in these cities during the Early Dynastic Period around 2900 BC.\n\n- In Egypt, the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under a single king happened around 3150 BC. Memphis is mentioned as becoming the capital at this time. \n\n- For the Indus Valley civilization, no specific cities with early kings are called out, but the early phases of this civilization date back to around 3300 BC.\n\n- In China, the semi-legendary Xia dynasty, considered the first dynasty described in historical records, may have been based at the Erlitou site, emerging around 1900 BC.

The initial search for \"Rings of the Solar System\" did not return a direct article, but the suggested searches included articles on the rings of specific planets like Saturn, Jupiter, and Neptune.

{"id":"e8200151f579bdf9","answer":"<result>\nThe United Kingdom, Canada, and Japan all have constitutional monarchies, where the monarch is the head of state but their role is largely ceremonial. The key points are:\n\nUnited Kingdom:\n- The monarch is King Charles III, who ascended the throne in 2022 upon the death of Queen Elizabeth II. \n- The monarch's role is defined as constitutional, meaning their power is limited by laws passed in Parliament. In practice, the monarch's role is largely ceremonial.\n- The monarch appoints the prime minister, who is the head of government. The prime minister and cabinet hold the real executive power.\n- The line of succession is determined by laws like the Bill of Rights 1689 and Act of Settlement 1701. The rules were recently changed to allow equal primogeniture.\n\nCanada:\n- King Charles III is also the King of Canada, but this is a separate title from his role as British monarch. \n- The King is represented in Canada by the Governor General at the federal level and lieutenant governors in the provinces. They carry out the monarch's constitutional duties on his behalf.\n- As in the UK, the monarch and his representatives have a largely ceremonial role, while the elected government holds political power.\n\nJapan:\n- The monarch is Emperor Naruhito, who ascended the throne in 2019 after the abdication of his father Akihito.\n- Under Japan's post-war constitution, the emperor is defined as \"the symbol of the State and of the unity of the People\" and has no political power. \n- The emperor appoints the prime minister as designated by the Diet (parliament), but has no power to refuse appointment.\n- The line of succession is limited to male descendants in the male line of the imperial family under the Imperial Household Law.\n\nSo in summary, while the specific rules and traditions differ, the UK, Canada and Japan all have monarchs that serve as ceremonial heads of state within the framework of a constitutional monarchy where an elected government holds political power.\n</result>"}
