According to Zuckerberg, the group planned to return to Harvard, but eventually decided to remain in California, where Zuckerberg appreciated the \"mythical place\" of Silicon Valley, the center of computer technology in California.[40][41] They had already turned down offers by major corporations to buy the company.

The meeting occurred after Zuckerberg participated in a Q&A session at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China, on October 23, 2014, where he conversed in Mandarin Chinese; although Facebook is banned in China, Zuckerberg is highly regarded among the people and was at the university to help fuel the nation's burgeoning entrepreneur sector.[64]\n\n\nZuckerberg fielded questions during a live Q&A session at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park on December 11, 2014.

It's definitely very core to my personality.\"[46]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA movie based on Zuckerberg and the founding years of Facebook, *The Social Network*, was released on October 1, 2010, starring Jesse Eisenberg as Zuckerberg.

University of Hawaii law professor Kapua Sproat stated that Zuckerberg's lawsuits was \"the face of neocolonialism\".[92] Zuckerberg responded to criticisms in a Facebook post, stating that the lawsuits were a good faith effort to pay the partial owners of the land their \"fair share\".[92] When he learned that Hawaiian land ownership law differs from that of the other 49 states, he dropped the lawsuits. Zuckerberg stated that he regretted not taking the time to understand the process and its history before moving ahead.[93][94]\n\n\n\n### Testimony before U.S. Congress[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n108. **^** \"Jesse Eisenberg Calls Mark Zuckerberg \"Sweet\" and \"Generous\" in His Funny Oscar Nominees Lunch Interview\" Archived February 10, 2011, at the Wayback Machine *Popsugar*, February 7, 2011\n109. **^** \"Mark Zuckerberg Meets Jesse Eisenberg On The 'Saturday Night Live' Stage\" Archived April 5, 2015, at the Wayback Machine NPR, January 30, 2011\n110. **^** \"The Facebook Effect: The Inside Story of the Company That Is Connecting the World\" Archived December 2, 2017, at the Wayback Machine, release date February 1, 2011\n111. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Rohrer, Finlo. \"Is the Facebook movie the truth about Mark Zuckerberg\" Archived November 23, 2018, at the Wayback Machine BBC, September 30, 2010\n112. **^** \"Facebook Creator Mark Zuckerberg to Get Yellow on The Simpsons\". *New York*.

He studied psychology and computer science and belonged to Alpha Epsilon Pi and Kirkland House.[23][14][24] In his sophomore year, he wrote a program that he called CourseMatch, which allowed users to make class selection decisions based on the choices of other students and help them form study groups. Later, he created a different program he initially called Facemash that let students select the best-looking person from a choice of photos. Arie Hasit, Zuckerberg's roommate at the time, explained:\n\n\n\n\n> We had books called Face Books, which included the names and pictures of everyone who lived in the student dorms. At first, he built a site and placed two pictures or pictures of two males and two females. Visitors to the site had to choose who was \"hotter\" and according to the votes there would be a ranking.[25]\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe couple also have a Puli dog named Beast,[196] who has over two million followers on Facebook.[197]\n\n\n\n### Religious beliefs[edit]\n\n\nRaised as a Reform Jew, Zuckerberg later identified as an atheist.

I was thinking about doing this anonymously just so that the two things could be kept separate.\"[125] Newark Mayor Cory Booker stated that he and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie had to convince Zuckerberg's team not to make the donation anonymously.[125] The money was largely wasted, according to journalist Dale Russakoff.[126][127]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe founders and contributors to the group were primarily Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and investors, and its president was Joe Green, a close friend of Zuckerberg.[160][161][162][163] The goals of the group include immigration reform, improving the state of education in the United States, and enabling more technological breakthroughs that benefit the public,[164][165] yet it has also been criticized for financing ads advocating a variety of oil and gas development initiatives, including drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the Keystone XL pipeline.[166] In 2013, numerous liberal and progressive groups, such as The League of Conservation Voters, MoveOn.org, the Sierra Club, Democracy for America, CREDO, Daily Kos, 350.org, and Presente and Progressives United agreed to either pull their Facebook ad buys or not buy Facebook ads for at least two weeks, in protest of Zuckerberg ads funded by FWD.us that were in support of oil drilling and the Keystone XL pipeline, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n26. **^** Video, Telegraph (February 2017). \"Mark Zuckerberg's career in 90 seconds\". *The Daily Telegraph*.

While Zuckerberg tried to convince the editors not to run the story,[32] he also broke into two of the editors' email accounts --- for which he made use of their private login data logs from TheFacebook.[33][34]\n\n\nFollowing the official launch of the Facebook social media platform, the three filed a lawsuit against Zuckerberg that resulted in a settlement.[35] The agreed settlement was for 1.2 million Facebook shares and $20 million in cash.[36]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![Waist high portrait of man in his twenties, looking into the camera and gesturing with both hands, wearing a black pullover shirt that says \"The North Face\" and wearing identification on a white band hanging from his neck](image)Zuckerberg at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland (January 2009)\nA month after Zuckerberg launched Facebook in February 2004, i2hub, another campus-only service, created by Wayne Chang and focusing on peer-to-peer file sharing, was launched. At the time, both i2hub and Facebook were gaining the attention of the press and growing rapidly in users and publicity. In August 2004, Zuckerberg, Andrew McCollum, Adam D'Angelo, and Sean Parker launched a competing peer-to-peer file sharing service called Wirehog, a precursor to Facebook Platform applications, which was launched in 2007.[74][75][76]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHaving media corporations owned by conglomerates is just not an attractive idea to me.\"[30] The same year, speaking at Y Combinator's *Startup School* course at Stanford University, Zuckerberg made a controversial assertion that \"young people are just smarter\" and that other entrepreneurs should bias towards hiring young people.[42]\n\n\nHe restated these goals to *Wired* magazine in 2010: \"The thing I really care about is the mission, making the world open.\"[43] Earlier, in April 2009, Zuckerberg had sought the advice of former Netscape CFO Peter Currie regarding financing strategies for Facebook.[44] On July 21, 2010, Zuckerberg reported that Facebook had reached the 500-million-user mark.[45] When asked whether Facebook could earn more income from advertising as a result of its phenomenal growth, he explained:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHarvard students Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra accused Zuckerberg of intentionally making them believe he would help them build a social network called HarvardConnection.com (later called ConnectU).[80] They filed a lawsuit in 2004; it was dismissed on a technicality on March 28, 2007. It was refiled soon thereafter in a federal court in Boston. Facebook countersued in regards to Social Butterfly, a project put out by The Winklevoss Chang Group, an alleged partnership between ConnectU and i2hub.

{"id":"3f834a73e6484b57","answer":"The Pacific Ocean is the largest and deepest of Earth's five oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south, and is bounded by the continents of Asia and Oceania in the west and the Americas in the east. The Pacific Ocean covers about 46% of Earth's water surface and about 32% of the planet's total surface area, larger than its entire land area.\n\nThe Pacific Ocean has an area of approximately 165,250,000 square kilometers (63,800,000 square miles). The North Pacific Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean are two largely independent volumes of water that meet at the equator. The Pacific Ocean is also home to the deepest known point on Earth, the Mariana Trench, which reaches a depth of 10,911 meters (35,797 feet).\n\nThe Pacific Ocean is a vital part of the global ecosystem and plays a significant role in climate patterns, marine life, and human activities. It is home to a diverse range of marine species and supports important fisheries. The ocean also serves as a major transportation route, connecting continents and facilitating global trade.\n\nIn summary, the areas of the five oceans on Earth in square kilometers are as follows:\n- Pacific Ocean: 165,250,000 square kilometers (63,800,000 square miles)\n- Atlantic Ocean: Not specified in the provided content\n- Indian Ocean: Not specified in the provided content\n- Arctic Ocean: Not specified in the provided content\n- Southern Ocean: Not specified in the provided content\n\nFor the most accurate and up-to-date information, it is recommended to consult reliable sources such as encyclopedias, scientific journals, or official geographic databases."}

The woman claims Roethlisberger raped her and further alleged that friends of the woman attempted to intervene out of worry, but the second of Roethlisberger's bodyguards, Edward Joyner—an off-duty Pennsylvania State Trooper—avoided eye contact and said he did not know what they were talking about.[331] The policemen claimed to \"have no memory\" of meeting the woman.[332]\n\n\nMilledgeville Police Sergeant Jerry Blash, who had posed for a photograph with Roethlisberger earlier in the evening, was the first officer to respond.[333] Blash later admitted denigrating the accuser and never formally questioning Roethlisberger; he did speak to the NFL player and his off-duty police bodyguards at the Capital City club.[327]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn Week 15 against the Green Bay Packers, Roethlisberger broke several franchise passing records in ending the five-game losing streak for the Steelers with the biggest passing day in franchise history. His first pass of the day was a 60-yard touchdown to Mike Wallace, and his last pass was a game-winning 19-yard touchdown to Wallace on the final play of the game. He passed for 503 yards, three touchdowns, and had no turnovers.[123] He broke Terry Bradshaw's single-season record of 3,724 passing yards, and set a new mark for single-season completions (302). After leading a FG drive to take a 30–28 lead, the defense again surrendered the lead and the Steelers trailed, 36–30. Roethlisberger used all 2:01 he had left to drive the team 86 yards for the winning touchdown with no time remaining.[124] Roethlisberger was named AFC Player of the Week for his effort; the fifth time he has won that award in his career.[125]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Roethlisberger leading the Steelers offense against the Kansas City Chiefs in the 2021 Wild Card round, his final game before retirement\nRoethlisberger signed a renegotiated contract with the Steelers on March 4, 2021, that saw him take a $5 million pay cut.[268][269] A day before the Week 10 game against the Detroit Lions, the Steelers placed Roethlisberger on Reserve/COVID-19 list after testing positive for the virus.[270][271]\n\n\nRoethlisberger finished the 2021 regular season with 3,740 passing yards, 22 touchdowns, and ten interceptions, and also had an additional rushing touchdown as the Steelers finished with a 9–7–1 record.[272] In the Wild Card Round against the Kansas City Chiefs, Roethlisberger threw for 215 yards and two touchdowns in the 42–21 loss.[273]\n\n\n\n### Retirement[edit]\n\n\nOn January 27, 2022, Roethlisberger announced his retirement from the NFL.[274]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the second quarter of the Week 14 game against the Cleveland Browns, Roethlisberger's leg was injured on a sack and he left the game. He returned for the second half and played the rest of the game, despite limping on his high-ankle sprain. He threw a game-clinching 79-yard touchdown pass to Antonio Brown late in the fourth quarter as the Steelers won 14–3. Roethlisberger finished with 280 yards passing on just 21 attempts for a career-high 13.33 YPA (min. 15 attempts).[157] On the injury, Roethlisberger said, \"It was one of the most painful things I ever felt. It felt like the middle of my leg was just, cracked ... it felt like my foot was outside of my leg.\"[158] In Week 15 against the San Francisco 49ers, Roethlisberger started the game while suffering through a high-ankle sprain. During the game, it was clear that Roethlisberger was still showing signs of the injury due to him limping between plays. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n265. **^** \"Wild Card – Cleveland Browns at Pittsburgh Steelers – January 10th, 2021\". *Pro-Football-Reference.com*.

Roethlisberger threw for 379 yards and three touchdowns on the way to a Steelers win and an AFC Offensive Player of the Week award;[201] his 379 passing yards were the most by a quarterback in relief since Don Strock threw for 403 yards for the Miami Dolphins against the San Diego Chargers in the Epic in Miami playoff game in 1982.[202] On November 29, Roethlisberger threw for 456 yards against the Seattle Seahawks, but he also threw two interceptions, and the Seahawks took a 39–30 win.[203]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn January 23 in the AFC Championship Game in Pittsburgh, Roethlisberger completed 14 of 24 pass attempts for 226 yards and two touchdowns, but he also threw three costly interceptions, one of which was returned 87 yards for a touchdown by Rodney Harrison.[54] The Steelers lost the game to the eventual Super Bowl champions, the New England Patriots, by a score of 41–27.[55]\n\n\n\n### 2005: First Super Bowl championship[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2005 Pittsburgh Steelers season\n\n![](image)Roethlisberger signs autographs at Super Bowl XL media day\nIn the 2005 regular season, the Steelers finished with an 11–5 record.

His run was the last touchdown of the game, sealing the win for the Steelers.[62]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTo cap his comeback season, Roethlisberger was selected to his first Pro Bowl, joining five other Steelers teammates on the AFC squad.[93] Roethlisberger's 32 touchdown passes ranked third in the NFL, behind Tony Romo and Tom Brady, while his 104.1 passer rating was second only to Brady.[94] Roethlisberger also set a new Steelers single-season record with 32 touchdown passes.[95]\n\n\nIn a rematch of the Week 15 game, the Steelers were defeated by the Jaguars in the AFC Wild Card Round, 31–29. In the loss, Roethlisberger passed for 337 yards, two touchdowns, and three interceptions.[96] Roethlisberger finished third in Comeback Player of the Year voting, behind the Patriots' Randy Moss and the Dallas Cowboys' Greg Ellis, who won the award.[97] Roethlisberger played in his first Pro Bowl in Hawaii.[98]\n\n\n\n### 2008: Second Super Bowl championship[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2008 Pittsburgh Steelers season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRoethlisberger had more touchdowns than incompletions on a statline of 22-of-25 for 328 yards and five touchdowns in his NFL-record fourth game with a perfect quarterback rating.[238] His performance in Week 10 earned him AFC Offensive Player of the Week for the second time in 2018.[239] In a Week 12 loss to the Denver Broncos, he passed for a season-high 462 yards, one touchdown, and two interceptions.[240] In Week 16, a 31–28 loss to the New Orleans Saints, he passed for 380 yards and three touchdowns in a loss that hurt their playoff chances.[241] Despite a win in Week 17, the Steelers missed the playoffs for the first time since 2013, finishing second in the AFC North with a 9–6–1 record.[242]\n\n\nRoethlisberger led the league in passing yards (5,129) for the second time in his career.[243] He led the league in completions (452), attempts (675) and interceptions (16).

Roethlisberger posted his first career 300-yard passing game, with 18 of 28 passes for 316 yards and a touchdown. He led his fifth game-winning drive of the season, capping a drive with a Jerome Bettis touchdown run for a 33–30 victory. Eli Manning threw an interception with 3:19 remaining to seal the game for Pittsburgh.[52]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn October 31, he had one of his biggest games, leading the Steelers to a 34–20 victory over the defending Super Bowl champion and previously undefeated New England Patriots, ending their NFL-record 21-game winning streak. He completed 18 of 24 pass attempts for 196 yards, two touchdowns, and no turnovers.[49] The next game, the Steelers defeated the also previously undefeated Philadelphia Eagles 27–3, with Roethlisberger going 11 of 18 for 183 yards, with two touchdowns and one interception.[50]\n\n\nOn December 5, he led the Steelers to a 17–16 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars. He was near-perfect on the night, completing 14 of 17 passes for 226 yards and two touchdowns. Jeff Reed's 37-yard field goal in the final minute gave the Steelers and Roethlisberger their tenth straight win.[51]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn Week 4 against the Baltimore Ravens, the Steelers trailed 13–3 at halftime. Roethlisberger threw a touchdown pass to Santonio Holmes in the third quarter to start a comeback. He completed two passes to Mewelde Moore for 31 yards in overtime, setting up Jeff Reed for the winning 46-yard field goal.[105] The next week, Roethlisberger threw for 239 yards in the first half—a career-high for one half—and directed the game-winning drive, passing for an eight-yard touchdown to Hines Ward to defeat the Jacksonville Jaguars by a score of 26–21.[106] He was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week and the FedEx Air Player of the Week for his performance.[107]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRoethlisberger had one of the worst performances of his career in a Week 9 23–6 win over the Washington Redskins, posting career lows in passer rating (15.1), completions (5), passing yards (50), yards per attempt (2.94) and completion percentage (29.4%).[108] In Week 13 at New England, in consistent rain, Roethlisberger completed 17 of 33 passes for 179 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception. After falling behind, 10–3, in the second quarter, Roethlisberger led the Steelers to 30 unanswered points in a 33–10 victory.[109]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the course of the regular 2005 season, Roethlisberger missed four games due to various knee injuries. The Steelers went 9–3 with Roethlisberger at quarterback and 2–2 without him. He led the league in yards per attempt, with an 8.90, and finished third in passer rating behind Peyton Manning and Carson Palmer with a 98.6.[57]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn Week 1 against the Houston Texans, Roethlisberger completed 13 of 14 passes for a career-high 92.9 completion percentage (minimum 10 attempts), and finished with 137 yards passing and two touchdown passes in the 38–17 win. Byron Leftwich took over in the fourth quarter when Roethlisberger was on the sideline with a shoulder injury.[101] The next week against the Cleveland Browns, he had the first pass reception of his career: a negative-seven-yard completion to himself after a deflected pass in the second quarter.[102] In a 15–6 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 3, Roethlisberger was sacked eight times, fumbled twice, threw one interception, and was called for a safety in the fourth quarter. He did not finish the game, as his throwing hand was injured.[103][104]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn Super Bowl XLV against the Green Bay Packers, Roethlisberger was hit as he attempted a pass to Mike Wallace in the first quarter, and it was intercepted for a touchdown by Nick Collins. The Steelers trailed, 21–3, in the second quarter before Roethlisberger completed a touchdown pass to Hines Ward to make it 21–10 at halftime. The Steelers closed to within 21–17 in the third quarter, but were unable to score on their next three drives. After falling behind, 28–17, in the fourth quarter, Roethlisberger threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to Mike Wallace, and then pitched the ball to Antwaan Randle El on an option run for the two-point conversion to make it 28–25. Taking over at his own 13 with 1:59 left and down 31–25, Roethlisberger was unable to lead the game-winning drive against Green Bay this time after his pass fell incomplete to Wallace on 4th and 5 at his own 33-yard line, ensuring the first Super Bowl loss of his career. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Roethlisberger in a Steelers' throwback jersey during 500th franchise win\nIn Week 9 against the Baltimore Ravens, Roethlisberger passed for a career-high five touchdown passes, which tied the team record held by Terry Bradshaw and Mark Malone. All five touchdowns were thrown in the first half, making Roethlisberger one of two quarterbacks in the 2007 season (the other being Tom Brady), and only the fifth quarterback since the 1970 merger, to accomplish such a feat. He also posted a perfect 158.3 passer rating.[85] Against the Browns in Week 10, Roethlisberger helped the Steelers erase a 15-point deficit against the rival Browns in a 31–28 victory. He passed for 278 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception to earn AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[86][87]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn Week 1 against the Cleveland Browns, Roethlisberger threw four touchdown passes in a game for the first time in his NFL career as he led the Steelers to a win in the debut of new Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin.[83] Against the Arizona Cardinals in Week 4, Roethlisberger looked to get a win over his former offensive coordinator Ken Whisenhunt, who was then the head coach of the Cardinals. However, Roethlisberger had his first loss of the season as he was intercepted twice; once in the red zone, and then on a desperation pass with six seconds left in the game.[84]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn Super Bowl XLIII against the Arizona Cardinals, Roethlisberger led the Steelers to one of the most dramatic victories in Super Bowl history. On the first two offensive drives, Roethlisberger passed for 122 yards on seven of eight passing attempts, which was one yard shy of his total amount from his first Super Bowl start. The Steelers led, 10–0, and went into halftime up, 17–7. The lead grew to 20–7 before Arizona mounted a comeback. Trailing for the first time in the game, 23–20, with 2:30 remaining in the game, Roethlisberger took the field to start the winning drive. After a holding penalty on the first play, Roethlisberger marched the Steelers 88 yards in eight plays, hooking up with game MVP Santonio Holmes four times for 73 yards on the drive, including the six-yard touchdown pass that put the Steelers ahead with 0:35 remaining.[114][115] Overall, Roethlisberger finished 21 of 30 for 256 yards, one touchdown, and one interception.

With the game tied at 20 in the final quarter, he led the Steelers on the game-winning field goal drive as they improved to 8–7.[126]\n\n\nRoethlisberger finished the season with 4,328 yards and 26 touchdown passes.[127] He was 9–6 as a starter and his 100.5 passer rating was the second time in his career he had a season with a rating over 100. He was sacked 50 times in 2009. Despite the three game win streak to end the season, the Steelers did not make the playoffs after tie-breakers eliminated them. Roethlisberger was voted as team MVP by the Steelers for the first time in his career.[128] He was selected as the first alternate to the Pro Bowl, but declined the invitation to rest his right shoulder which was injured in the Miami game.[129]\n\n\n\n### 2010: Third Super Bowl appearance[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Steelers won Super Bowl XL 21–10 over the Seattle Seahawks in Detroit on February 5.[63] Roethlisberger had one of the worst passing games of his career, completing just nine of 21 passes for 123 yards and two interceptions; his passer rating of 22.6 was the lowest in Super Bowl history by a winning quarterback. Though he did convert eight third-down situations in the game to help the Steelers win, none of them was bigger than his 37-yard pass to Super Bowl XL MVP Hines Ward on a third-and-28 that set up the Steelers' first touchdown (a one-yard quarterback sneak by Roethlisberger on third and goal). With the victory, Roethlisberger, at 23 years old, became the youngest quarterback to win the Super Bowl, a record previously held by Tom Brady of the New England Patriots.[64][65]\n\n\n\n### 2006[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2006 Pittsburgh Steelers season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter starting the season with a loss to the Iowa Hawkeyes, Roethlisberger led the Miami RedHawks to an unbeaten record in the MAC, 12 consecutive wins, a #10 ranking in the Associated Press poll, and a 49–28 victory over Louisville in the 2003 GMAC Bowl.[19][20] He finished his 2003 season with a conference-leading 343 completions, 4,486 passing yards, and 37 passing touchdowns, breaking school single-season records in all three categories.[13] He was named as the MAC Offensive Player of the Year for the 2003 season.[21]\n\n\nHis jersey number number 7 was retired by the RedHawks during homecoming on October 13, 2007; the festivities included the RedHawks football game against Bowling Green. Roethlisberger became the third athlete in Miami football history to have his number retired, joining John Pont and Bob Hitchens.

Roethlisberger threw for 197 yards and recorded a game-saving tackle on Colts' defensive back Nick Harper, who had just recovered a Jerome Bettis fumble with less than two minutes left in the game. Pittsburgh led early but had to survive a Colts comeback to win 21–18, after an errant call that the NFL later admitted was a mistake,[60] which overturned a Troy Polamalu interception that would have secured the game for the Steelers. Roethlisberger's tackle on Harper, dubbed by many as The Tackle II or The Immaculate Redemption, was compared by many to \"The Immaculate Reception\" in 1972, when Franco Harris made a miraculous reception and scored the game-winning touchdown against the Oakland Raiders. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn his first win over the Oakland Raiders in Week 11, Roethlisberger passed for 275 yards and three touchdowns, and rushed for a career-high 55 yards and a[137] touchdown. Celebrating a second-quarter touchdown pass, Roethlisberger was punched in the face by Raiders' defensive lineman Richard Seymour, who was then ejected.[138] Roethlisberger was questionable to start the Week 13 game against the Baltimore Ravens with a foot injury, but did start the game and suffered a broken nose on the first series after a hit to the face from Haloti Ngata. Trailing 10–6 in the fourth quarter, Roethlisberger threw a go-ahead touchdown pass to Isaac Redman with 2:51 remaining and the Steelers held on for the 13–10 win as he finished with 253 yards passing.[139]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRoethlisberger is a Christian. Roethlisberger grew up as a Christian but recommitted to his faith in 2017. Roethlisberger has said \"Go ahead and be the best athlete you can possibly be, and see if you can be a better Christian. That's what I'm trying to do now. I'm trying to be a better Christian than I am athlete and football player.\"[301]\n\n\nRoethlisberger is a spokesman for Swiss Roots, a campaign intended to help Americans of Swiss origin reconnect with their Swiss ancestral heritage.[302] In May 2006, Roethlisberger and his family traveled to Switzerland for a week.[302][303]\n\n\nHe has his own line of barbecue sauce, Big Ben's BBQ, and is an investor in tech startups, including neonatal care company, NeoLight.[304][305]\n\n\n\n## Controversy[edit]\n\n\n### Motorcycle accident[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn Week 3 against the Cincinnati Bengals, the Steelers were dominant in the first half and led, 20–9, in the fourth quarter, but the defense surrendered the lead with 14 seconds left. Roethlisberger got the ball back with two seconds remaining and his Hail Mary attempt was incomplete. It is his first NFL loss in the state of Ohio, snapping an 11–0 record.[116] He improved his record of 10–0 against the Cleveland Browns by throwing for 417 yards and 2 touchdowns in Week 6.[117] In Week 11 against the Kansas City Chiefs, he had thrown for 398 yards and three touchdowns before leaving the game in overtime after taking a knee to the helmet on a scramble attempt.[118][119] He suffered the fourth concussion of his NFL career.[120] After sitting out the overtime loss in Week 12 at Baltimore, Roethlisberger started against the Oakland Raiders in Week 13 and passed for 278 yards and two touchdown passes. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Super Bowl run began on January 8 as Roethlisberger helped lead the Steelers to a Divisional Round playoff win over the Cincinnati Bengals—an AFC North rival that had beaten the Steelers by seven points in the regular season to win the division championship. The rematch featured two teams with identical records, having split their regular season series since each team won on the road. Early in the game on Carson Palmer's first throw, a tackle by former Bengal Kimo von Oelhoffen resulted in Palmer's anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) being completely torn.[58] The Bengals' backup quarterback, Jon Kitna, came in and led the Bengals to leads of 10–0 and 17–7. However, the 17–7 lead midway through the second quarter was the last time in the 2005 postseason that the Steelers trailed an opponent by more than three points. After Kitna failed to produce, the Steelers took advantage by taking the next 24 straight points, and the win, in a 31–17 victory in Cincinnati.[59]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRoethlisberger was one of 17 quarterbacks taken in the 2004 NFL Draft, along with Manning and Rivers.[34] All three would enjoy lengthy and successful careers with the teams that signed them and have been compared favorably to the aforementioned 1983 Draft, which included Hall of Fame quarterbacks John Elway, Jim Kelly, and Marino.[38] A two-time Super Bowl winner and six-time Pro Bowler, Roethlisberger leads the three in wins, winning percentage, and postseason appearances, and had the longest career among them.[27][39][40][34]\n\n\n\n### 2004[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2004 Pittsburgh Steelers season\n\nOn August 4, Roethlisberger signed a six-year contract to the Steelers worth $22.26 million in salaries and bonuses, with an additional $17.73 million available via incentives.

Roethlisberger walked with the other graduates at the commencement ceremony, with his parents, grandmother, and wife Ashley in attendance.[169] He had planned on finishing his degree sooner, but the Steelers having deep playoff runs earlier in his career prevented him from registering for classes in time for the winter term, only being able to do it after the Steelers were eliminated in the Wild Card round against the Denver Broncos the previous season.[169] Roethlisberger became the second member of the Steelers in less than a year to return to college and complete his degree, with teammate Polamalu doing the same thing the previous off-season during the 2011 NFL lockout.[170]\n\n\n\n### 2013[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2013 Pittsburgh Steelers season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe threw a go-ahead touchdown pass to Hines Ward with 1:56 remaining, only to have the Raiders answer back with a winning touchdown with nine seconds left.

It was the fifth loss of the season in which they surrendered the lead in the final quarter.[121]\n\n\nOn a frigid Thursday night in Cleveland in Week 14, Roethlisberger was sacked 8 times and did not lead a touchdown drive in his first career loss to Cleveland, ending a perfect 10–0 record against the rival Browns.

He underwent surgery on October 17 for a torn meniscus and missed the following week against the New England Patriots.[212] The Steelers made the playoffs, winning the AFC North with an 11–5 record.[213] They defeated the Miami Dolphins by a score of 30–12 in the Wild Card Round and beat the Chiefs 18–16 in the Divisional Round.[214][215] However, the Steelers lost 36–17 to the Patriots in the AFC Championship.

The Steelers trailed, 21–7, in the third quarter before Roethlisberger completed touchdown passes to Heath Miller and Hines Ward to tie the game at 21. With just over two minutes left, the game was tied, 24–24, and the Steelers faced a 3rd and 19. Roethlisberger completed a deep pass to rookie wide receiver Antonio Brown for 58 yards and Rashard Mendenhall's rushing touchdown put the Steelers ahead for good, 31–24, with 1:33 left.

The Steelers opted to start Roethlisberger over Batch because of the possibility that Baltimore could drop its final game, and a win by the Steelers would take back the division title. Despite his injury, Mike Tomlin and the coaching staff believed Roethlisberger gave them their best chance at victory. Big Ben completed 23 of 40 passes for 221 yards with no touchdowns or interceptions. Baltimore went on to win their final game and secured the division title, leaving Steelers with the number 5 seed to face Denver in the Wild Card round of the playoffs.[161]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>"}

{"id":"7aa2ea41fafb590d","answer":"The atmosphere of Neptune is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, along with traces of hydrocarbons and possibly nitrogen, but contains a higher proportion of *ices* such as water, ammonia and methane.

{"id":"5fd35242fe55995e","answer":"Rohit Sharma is an Indian international cricketer and the current captain of the India national cricket team in all formats. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of this era, known for his timing, elegance, six-hitting abilities, and leadership skills. Sharma holds the record for the most international sixes across all formats and also the most number of sixes in a calendar year. He plays as a right-handed batsman for the India national cricket team in international cricket, Mumbai Indians in the IPL, and for Mumbai in domestic cricket.\n\nSharma clinched the world record for the highest ever individual score in a one-day international match, with a remarkable 264 against Sri Lanka at Eden Gardens, Kolkata, on November 13, 2014. He is the only player to have scored three double-centuries in this form of international cricket. In January 2020, Sharma was named as the ODI Player of the Year by the International Cricket Council (ICC). During the 2019 World Cup, Sharma became the only batsman to score five centuries in a single edition of the Cricket World Cup.\n\nOn October 11, 2023, Sharma achieved a historic feat during the 2023 Cricket World Cup match against Afghanistan, when he surpassed the record previously held by Chris Gayle for the most international sixes (553). His powerful and elegant batting style, coupled with his consistency, allowed him to reach this milestone with 556 sixes, overtaking Gayle's record.\n\nOn October 14, 2023, Sharma achieved a milestone in the world of cricket by becoming the first Indian to complete 300 sixes in the 50-overs format. This feat occurred during a highly anticipated India-Pakistan match at Narendra Modi Stadium, in front of more than 1 lakh enthusiastic fans. The Indian skipper's ability to consistently clear the boundary ropes with his powerful and elegant strokeplay has made him a dynamic force in limited-overs cricket. This achievement further solidifies his status as one of India's premier batsmen and a cricketing legend.\n\nSharma has been one of the most successful players in the IPL as captain since 2013 of the Mumbai Indians, who have won the tournament five times under his leadership, making him the most successful captain in IPL history, sharing this record with MS Dhoni (5 title wins in IPL). With India, Sharma was a member of the team that won the 2007 T20 World Cup, and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, where he played in the finals of both tournaments. Rohit is one of four players to have played in every edition of the ICC T20 World Cup, from the inaugural edition in 2007 to the latest one in 2022.\n\nSharma has been sponsored by several brands including CEAT and the Swiss watchmaker Hublot. In his career, Sharma has endorsed many other brands including Maggi, Fair and Lovely, Lay's, Nissan, energy drink Relentless, Nasivion nasal spray, Aristocrat by VIP Industries, Adidas, and Oppo mobiles.\n\nSharma engages in numerous philanthropic activities, promoting various causes such as animal welfare, health, and children. He is particularly vocal about the protection of animals and has supported various initiatives and organizations to promote the cause. In February 2015, Sharma joined People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) to support sterilization of homeless cats and dogs. When supporting the cause, Sharma said, \"Sterilization is important because I feel that if we can stop (the homeless-animal crisis), there will be control of population among the street dogs.\"\n\nSharma married his longtime girlfriend, Ritika Sajdeh, on December 13, 2015. They have one child, a girl born in 2018. She is a practitioner of the meditation technique Sahaj Marg. He practices an eggetarian diet.\n\nSharma has received two national honors, the Arjuna Award in 2015 and the prestigious Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna in 2020. Under his captaincy, India won the 2018 Asia Cup and the 2023 Asia Cup, the seventh and eighth time the country won the title, both in ODI format as well as the 2018 Nidahas Trophy, their second overall and first in T20I format.\n\nOutside cricket, Sharma is an active supporter of animal welfare campaigns. He is the official Rhino Ambassador for WWF-India and is a member of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). He has worked with PETA in its campaign to raise awareness of the plight of homeless cats and dogs in India."}

{"id":"896ef3f2a5ef858e","answer":"<document>\n<title>University of Padua</title>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **University of Padua** (Italian: *Università degli Studi di Padova*, **UNIPD**) is an Italian public research university in Padua, Italy. It was founded in 1222 by a group of students and teachers from the University of Bologna,[2] thus, it is the second-oldest university in Italy, as well as the world's fifth-oldest surviving university.[3]\n\n\nThe University of Padua was one of the most prominent universities in early modern Europe, known particularly for the rigor of its Aristotelean logic and science.[4] Together with the University of Bologna, Padua had a central role in the italian renaissance, housing and educating a number of italian renaissance mathemathicians, amongst them Nicolaus Copernicus. \n\n\nToday, it is made up of 32 departments and eight schools.[5] Padua is part a network of historical research universities known as the Coimbra Group.[6] In 2021, the university had approximately 72,000 students including undergraduates, postgraduates, and doctoral students.[7]\n\n\n\n## Contents\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe last years of the nineteenth and the first half of the twentieth century saw a reversal of the centralisation process that had taken place in the sixteenth: scientific institutes were set up in what became veritable campuses; a new building to house the Arts and Philosophy faculty was built in another part of the city centre (*Palazzo del Liviano*, designed by Giò Ponti); the Astro-Physics Observatory was built on the Asiago uplands; and the old *Palazzo del Bo* was fully restored (1938–1945). The vicissitudes of the Fascist period—political interference, the Race Laws, etc.—had a detrimental effect upon the development of the university, as did the devastation caused by the Second World War and—just a few decades later—the effect of the student protests of 1968–1969 (which the university was left to face without adequate help and support from central government). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 1 History\n* 2 Organization and administration\n\t+ 2.1 Finances\n* 3 Rankings\n* 4 Notable people\n\t+ 4.1 Alumni\n\t+ 4.2 Notable faculty\n* 5 Departments\n* 6 Schools\n* 7 See also\n* 8 References\n* 9 External links\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe university is conventionally said to have been founded in 1222 when a large group of students and professors left the University of Bologna in search of more academic freedom ('Libertas scholastica'). The first subjects to be taught were law and theology. The curriculum expanded rapidly, and by 1399 the institution had divided in two: a *Universitas Iuristarum* for civil law and Canon law, and a *Universitas Artistarum* which taught astronomy, dialectic, philosophy, grammar, medicine, and rhetoric. There was also a Universitas Theologorum, established in 1373 by Urban V.\n\n\nThe student body was divided into groups known as \"nations\" which reflected their places of origin. The nations themselves fell into two groups:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe university foresaw a budget of €831 million for the 2023 fiscal year. Of this, €545 million were contributions paid by the Ministry of Education, University and Research of Italy, the European Union, local administrations like regions and provinces, and other entities. The remaining €232 million were classified as own revenues, of which €106 million came from tuition fees and €125 million from research-related income.[10]\n\n\nThe amount of tuition students pay depends on their major, the financial situation of their household and if they take more time to graduate compared to the established length of their program. Tuition is also significantly lowered for non-EU citizens of certain developing countries. There are also scholarships and fee-waivers based on merit on other factors. Generally, most students who are graduating in time and are not from low income households will pay around €2,700/year for the 2023/24 academic year. [11]\n\n\n\n## Rankings[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHowever, the Gymnasium Omnium Disciplinarum continued its work uninterrupted, and overall the second half of the twentieth century saw a sharp upturn in development—primarily due an interchange of ideas with international institutions of the highest standing (particularly in the fields of science and technology).\n\n\nIn recent years, the university has been able to meet the problems posed by overcrowded facilities by re-deploying over the Veneto as a whole. In 1990, the Institute of Management Engineering was set up in Vicenza, after which the summer courses at Brixen (Bressanone) began once more, and in 1995 the Agripolis centre at Legnaro (for Agricultural Science and Veterinary Medicine) opened. Other sites of re-deployment are at Rovigo, Treviso, Feltre, Castelfranco Veneto, Conegliano, Chioggia and Asiago.\n\n\nRecent changes in state legislation have also opened the way to greater autonomy for Italian universities, and in 1995 Padua adopted a new Statute that gave it greater independence.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe university is constantly ranked among the best Italian universities.\n\n\nFor 2023, in *U.S. News & World Report*'s *World Best Global Universities Rankings*, the University of Padua is ranked as the 1st place institution in Italy, taking 43rd place in Europe and the world's 115th.[12] ARWU ranks the university in the Italian top 4, tied for 2nd place with the University of Milan and the University of Pisa under the Sapienza University of Rome. ARWU ranks the university in the 151st-200th range globally for 2023.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 2024 *Times Higher Education World University Rankings* lists the university at 4th place in Italy and in the 201st-250th range worldwide. QS World University Rankings ranks the university 4th in Italy in 2024 and the best in Italy to study geology and geophysics, earth and sea sciences, biological sciences, psychology, anatomy and physiology. It also places the University of Padua at 219nd in the world for 2024.[14] Also, according to QS World University Rankings, the University of Padua is ranked 125th in the field of Medicine.[15]\n\n\nThe NTU ranking, which focuses on productivity and quality of scientific production, places the University of Padua as 82nd worldwide for 2022.[16]\n\n\nThe CWTS Leiden Ranking, based exclusively on bibliometric indicators, places the University of Padua as 2st place in Italy and 104nd worldwide.[17]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs the publications of innumerable conferences and congresses show, the modern-day University of Padua plays an important role in scholarly and scientific research at both a European and world level. True to its origins, this is the direction in which the university intends to move in the future, establishing closer links of cooperation and exchange with all the world's major research universities.\n\n\nSince 2022, the University of Padua has been experiencing difficulties with the payments of scholarships for the \"right to study\". Thus, leaving 1955 students (207 of that international students) without any kind of accommodation and receiving stipends.\n\n\n\n## Organization and administration[edit]\n\n\n### Finances[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1. the *cismontanes* for the Italian students\n2. the *ultramontanes* for those who came from beyond the Alps\n\n\nFrom the fifteenth to the eighteenth century, the university was renowned for its research, particularly in the areas of medicine, astronomy, philosophy and law. At the time it was the most renowned school of medicine internationally.[8] During this time, the university adopted the Latin motto: *Universa universis patavina libertas* (Paduan Freedom is Universal for Everyone). Nevertheless, the university had a turbulent history, and there was no teaching in 1237–1261, 1509–1517, 1848–1850.\n\n\nThe Botanical Garden of Padova, established by the university in 1545, is one of the oldest gardens of its kind in the world. Its alleged title of oldest academic garden is in controversy because the Medici created one in Pisa in 1544. In addition to the garden, best visited in the spring and summer, the university also manages nine museums, including a History of physics museum.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe university became one of the universities of the Kingdom of Italy in 1873, and ever since has been one of the most prestigious in the country for its contributions to scientific and scholarly research: in the field of mathematics alone, its professors have included such figures as Gregorio Ricci Curbastro, Giuseppe Veronese, Francesco Severi and Tullio Levi Civita.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The university houses the oldest surviving permanent anatomical theatre in Europe, dating from 1595\nThe university began teaching medicine around 1250. It played a leading role in the identification and treatment of diseases and ailments, specializing in autopsies and the inner workings of the body.[9]\n\n\nSince 1595, Padua's famous anatomical theatre drew artists and scientists studying the human body during public dissections. It is the oldest surviving permanent anatomical theatre in Europe. Anatomist Andreas Vesalius held the chair of Surgery and Anatomy (*explicator chirurgiae*) and in 1543 published his anatomical discoveries in De Humani Corporis Fabrica. The book triggered great public interest in dissections and caused many other European cities to establish anatomical theatres.\n\n\nOn 25 June 1678, Elena Lucrezia Cornaro Piscopia, a Venetian noblewoman and mathematician, became the first woman to be awarded a Doctor of Philosophy degree.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Scholars and Literati at the University of Padua (1222–1800), Repertorium Eruditorum Totius Europae – RETE\n* University of Padua Website (in Italian and English)\n* Museums of the University (in Italian and English)\n* Faculty of Engineering (in Italian and English)\n* University Human Rights Centre (in English)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Palazzo Bo is the historical seat of University of Padua since 1493\n![](image)Diploma of Girolamo Martinengo, 1582\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)\n |\n| Bosnia and Herzegovina | * University Džemal Bijedić of Mostar\n* University of Banja Luka\n* University of Mostar\n* University of Sarajevo\n* University of Zenica\n |\n| Croatia | * University of Rijeka\n* University of Split\n* University of Zadar\n |\n| Greece | * University of Ioannina\n* Ionian University\n* University of Patras\n* Technological Educational Institute of Western Greece\n* Technological Educational Institute of Epirus\n |\n| Italy | * Marche Polytechnic University\n* University of Bologna\n* University of Camerino\n* D'Annunzio University of Chieti–Pescara\n* University of Ferrara\n* University of Macerata\n* University of Messina\n* University of Milano-Bicocca\n* University of Padua\n* University of Teramo\n* University of Trieste\n* University of Udine\n* University of Urbino\n* Ca' Foscari University of Venice\n |\n| Montenegro | * Mediterranean University\n* University of Donja Gorica\n* University of Montenegro\n |\n| Serbia | * University of Arts in Belgrade\n* University of Belgrade\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Coats of arms of professors and students in the Aula Magna, Palazzo Bo.

{"id":"c479aff37fab9d33","answer":"<document>\n<title>Paris</title>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Parc des Princes\nParis's most popular sport clubs are the association football club Paris Saint-Germain F.C. and the rugby union clubs Stade Français and Racing 92, the last of which is based just outside the city proper. The 80,000-seat Stade de France, built for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, is located just north of Paris in the commune of Saint-Denis.[272] It is used for football, rugby union and track and field athletics. It hosts the France national football team for friendlies and major tournaments qualifiers, annually hosts the French national rugby team's home matches of the Six Nations Championship, and hosts several important matches of the Stade Français rugby team.[272] In addition to Paris Saint-Germain F.C., the city has a number of other professional and amateur football clubs: Paris FC, Red Star, RCF Paris and Stade Français Paris.\n\n\nParis hosted the 1900 and 1924 Summer Olympics and will host the 2024 Summer Olympics and Paralympic Games.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nParis hosts several United Nations organizations including UNESCO, and other international organizations such as the OECD, the OECD Development Centre, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, the International Energy Agency, the International Federation for Human Rights, along with European bodies such as the European Space Agency, the European Banking Authority or the European Securities and Markets Authority. The football club Paris Saint-Germain and the rugby union club Stade Français are based in Paris. The 80,000-seat Stade de France, built for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, is located just north of Paris in the neighbouring commune of Saint-Denis. Paris hosts the annual French Open Grand Slam tennis tournament on the red clay of Roland Garros. The city hosted the Olympic Games in 1900 and 1924, and will host the 2024 Summer Olympics. The 1938 and 1998 FIFA World Cups, the 2007 Rugby World Cup, as well as the 1960, 1984 and 2016 UEFA European Championships were also held in the city. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe official estimated population of the City of Paris on 1 January 1, 2023 was 2,102,650, down from 2,165,423 on January 1, 2022, according to the INSEE, the official French statistical agency. According to INSEE, the population has dropped by 122,919, or about five percent, over the past decade. The Mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, declared that this illustrated the \"de-densification\" of the city, creating more green space and less crowding.[153][154] Despite the drop, Paris remains the most densely-populated city in Europe, with 252 residents per hectare, not counting parks.[155] This drop was attributed partly to a lower birth rate, the departure of middle-class residents and the possible loss of housing in the city due to short-term rentals for tourism.[156]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nParis is the fourth largest municipality in the European Union, following Berlin, Madrid and Rome. Eurostat places Paris (6.5 million people) behind London (8 million) and ahead of Berlin (3.5 million), based on the 2012 populations of what Eurostat calls \"urban audit core cities\".[157]\nThe population of Paris today is lower than its historical peak of 2.9 million in 1921.[158] The principal reasons were a significant decline in household size, and a dramatic migration of residents to the suburbs between 1962 and 1975. Factors in the migration included de-industrialisation, high rent, the gentrification of many inner quarters, the transformation of living space into offices, and greater affluence among working families. The city's population loss came to a temporary halt at the beginning of the 21st century; the population increased from 2,125,246 in 1999 to 2,240,621 in 2012, before declining again slightly in 2017, 2018, and again in 2021.[159][160]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the 17th century, Cardinal Richelieu, chief minister of Louis XIII, was determined to make Paris the most beautiful city in Europe. He built five new bridges, a new chapel for the College of Sorbonne, and a palace for himself, the Palais-Cardinal. After Richelieu's death in 1642, it was renamed the Palais-Royal.[46]\n\n\n\n![](image)Lutetia Parisiorum vulgo Paris, Plan de Paris en 1657, Jan Janssonius\nDue to the Parisian uprisings during the Fronde civil war, Louis XIV moved his court to a new palace, Versailles, in 1682. Although no longer the capital of France, arts and sciences in the city flourished with the Comédie-Française, the Academy of Painting, and the French Academy of Sciences. To demonstrate that the city was safe from attack, the king had the city walls demolished and replaced with tree-lined boulevards that would become the *Grands Boulevards*.[47] Other marks of his reign were the Collège des Quatre-Nations, the Place Vendôme, the Place des Victoires, and Les Invalides.[48]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nParis is the core of a built-up area that extends well beyond its limits: commonly referred to as the *agglomération Parisienne*, and statistically as a *unité urbaine* (a measure of urban area), the Paris agglomeration's population of 10,785,092 in 2017[161] made it the largest urban area in the European Union.[162] City-influenced commuter activity reaches well beyond even this in a statistical *aire d'attraction* de Paris (\"functional area\", a statistical method comparable to a metropolitan area[163]), that had a population of 13,024,518 in 2017,[164] 19.6% of the population of France,[165] and the largest metropolitan area in the Eurozone.[162]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSixty-two percent of its buildings date from 1949 and before, 20 percent were built between 1949 and 1974, and only 18 percent of the buildings remaining were built after that date.[139] Two-thirds of the city's 1.3 million residences are studio and two-room apartments. Paris averages 1.9 people per residence, a number that has remained constant since the 1980s, but it is much less than Île-de-France's 2.33 person-per-residence average. Only 33 percent of principal residence Parisians own their habitation (against 47 percent for the entire Île-de-France): the major part of the city's population is a rent-paying one.[139] Social or public housing represented 19.9 percent of the city's total residences in 2017. Its distribution varies widely throughout the city, from 2.6 percent of the housing in the wealthy 7th arrondissement, to 39.9 percent in the 19th arrondissement.[140]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to the INSEE, between 4 and 5 million French residents were born or had at least one parent born in a predominantly Muslim country, particularly Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. An IFOP survey in 2008 reported that, of immigrants from these predominantly Muslim countries, 25 percent went to the mosque regularly; 41 percent practised the religion, and 34 percent were believers but did not practice the religion.[174][175] In 2012 and 2013, it was estimated that there were almost 500,000 Muslims in the City of Paris, 1.5 million Muslims in the Île-de-France region and 4 to 5 million Muslims in France.[176][177]\n\n\nThe Jewish population of the Paris Region was estimated in 2014 to be 282,000, the largest concentration of Jews in the world outside of Israel and the United States.[178]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Paris\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe city also hosted the finals of the 1938 FIFA World Cup (at the Stade Olympique de Colombes), as well as the 1998 FIFA World Cup and the 2007 Rugby World Cup Final (both at the Stade de France). Three UEFA Champions League Finals in the current century have also been played in the Stade de France: the 2000, 2006 and 2022.[273] Paris hosted UEFA Euro 2016.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nExcluding the outlying parks of Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes, Paris covers an oval measuring about 87 km2 (34 sq mi) in area, enclosed by the 35 km (22 mi) ring road, the Boulevard Périphérique.[95] The city's last major annexation of outlying territories in 1860 not only gave it its modern form but also created the 20 clockwise-spiralling arrondissements (municipal boroughs). From the 1860 area of 78 km2 (30 sq mi), the city limits were expanded marginally to 86.9 km2 (33.6 sq mi) in the 1920s. In 1929, the Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes forest parks were officially annexed to the city, bringing its area to about 105 km2 (41 sq mi).[96] The metropolitan area is 2,300 km2 (890 sq mi).[93]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe population of Paris had dropped by 100,000 during the Revolution, but after 1799 it surged with 160,000 new residents, reaching 660,000 by 1815.[57] Napoleon replaced the elected government of Paris with a prefect that reported directly to him. He began erecting monuments to military glory, including the Arc de Triomphe, and improved the neglected infrastructure of the city with new fountains, the Canal de l'Ourcq, Père Lachaise Cemetery and the city's first metal bridge, the Pont des Arts.[57]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nModern Paris owes much of its downtown plan and architectural harmony to Napoleon III and his Prefect of the Seine, Baron Haussmann. Between 1853 and 1870 they rebuilt the city centre, created the wide downtown boulevards and squares where the boulevards intersected, imposed standard facades along the boulevards, and required that the facades be built of the distinctive cream-grey \"Paris stone\". They also built the major parks around the city centre.[133] The high residential population of its city centre also makes it much different from most other western major cities.[134]\n\n\nParis's urbanism laws have been under strict control since the early 17th century,[135] particularly where street-front alignment, building height and building distribution is concerned.[135] The 210 m (690 ft) Tour Montparnasse was both Paris's and France's tallest building since 1973,[136] but this record has been held by the La Défense quarter Tour First tower in Courbevoie since its 2011 construction.\n\n\n\n### Housing[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nParis is a city of books and bookstores. In the 1970s, 80 percent of French-language publishing houses were found in Paris.[226] It is also a city of small bookstores. There are about 150 bookstores in the 5th arrondissement alone, plus another 250 book stalls along the Seine. Small Paris bookstores are protected against competition from discount booksellers by French law; books, even e-books, cannot be discounted more than five percent below their publisher's cover price.[227]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Music in Paris and History of music in Paris\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Paris region hosts France's highest concentration of the *grandes écoles* – 55 specialised centres of higher-education outside or inside the public university structure. The prestigious public universities are usually considered *grands établissements*. Most of the *grandes écoles* were relocated to the suburbs of Paris in the 1960s and 1970s, in new campuses much larger than the old campuses within the crowded City of Paris, though the École Normale Supérieure, PSL University has remained on rue d'Ulm in the 5th arrondissement.[312]\n\n\n\n### Healthcare[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe mayor of Paris is elected indirectly by Paris voters; the voters of each of the city's 20 arrondissements elect members to the *Conseil de Paris* (Council of Paris), which subsequently elects the mayor. The council is composed of 163 members, with each arrondissement allocated a number of seats dependent upon its population, from 10 members for each of the least-populated arrondissements to 34 members for the most populated. The council is elected using closed list proportional representation in a two-round system. Party lists winning an absolute majority in the first round – or at least a plurality in the second round – automatically win half the seats of an arrondissement. The remaining half of seats are distributed proportionally to all lists which win at least 5% of the vote using the highest averages method.[112] This ensures that the winning party or coalition always wins a majority of the seats, even if they do not win an absolute majority of the vote.[113]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIncomes are higher in the Western part of the city and in the western suburbs than in the northern and eastern parts of the urban area.[199] While Paris has some of the richest neighbourhoods in France, it also has some of the poorest, mostly on the eastern side of the city. In 2012, 14 percent of households in the city earned less than €977 per month, the official poverty line. Twenty-five percent of residents in the 19th arrondissement lived below the poverty line; in the city's wealthiest neighbourhood, the 7th arrondissement, 7 percent lived below the poverty line.[200] The unemployment rate in Paris in the 4th trimester of 2021 was six percent, compared with 7.4 percent in the whole of France. This was the lowest rate in thirteen years.[201][202]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tourism in Paris\n\nFurther information: Landmarks in Paris, Historical quarters of Paris, and List of tourist attractions in Paris\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe City of Paris is the centre of the Île-de-France region, or Paris Region, with an official estimated population of 12,271,794 inhabitants on January 1, 2023, or about 19% of the population of France,[2] making the region France's primate city. The Paris Region had a GDP of €765 billion (US$1.064 trillion, PPP)[8] in 2021, the highest in the European Union.[9] According to the Economist Intelligence Unit Worldwide Cost of Living Survey, in 2022, Paris was the city with the ninth-highest cost of living in the world.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789, by Jean-Pierre Houël\n![](image)The Panthéon, a major landmark on the Rive Gauche, was completed in 1790.\nParis was the centre of an explosion of philosophic and scientific activity, known as the Age of Enlightenment. Diderot and d'Alembert published their *Encyclopédie* in 1751, and the Montgolfier Brothers launched the first manned flight in a hot air balloon on 21 November 1783. Paris was the financial capital of continental Europe, and the primary European centre of book publishing, fashion and the manufacture of fine furniture and luxury goods.[52]\n\n\nIn the summer of 1789, Paris became the centre stage of the French Revolution. On 14 July, a mob seized the arsenal at the Invalides, acquiring thousands of guns, and stormed the Bastille, which was a principal symbol of royal authority. The first independent Paris Commune, or city council, met in the *Hôtel de Ville* and elected a Mayor, the astronomer Jean Sylvain Bailly, on 15 July.[53]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nParis and its region host the headquarters of several international organisations including UNESCO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the International Chamber of Commerce, the Paris Club, the European Space Agency, the International Energy Agency, the *Organisation internationale de la Francophonie*, the European Union Institute for Security Studies, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, the International Exhibition Bureau, and the International Federation for Human Rights.\n\n\n\n### Police force[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Police (Gendarmerie) motorcyclists\nThe security of Paris is mainly the responsibility of the Prefecture of Police of Paris, a subdivision of the Ministry of the Interior. It supervises the units of the National Police who patrol the city and the three neighbouring departments. It is also responsible for providing emergency services, including the Paris Fire Brigade. Its headquarters is on Place Louis Lépine on the Île de la Cité.[129]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince the inauguration of its first line in 1900, Paris's Métro network has grown to become the city's most widely used local transport system; today it carries about 5.23 million passengers daily[283] through 16 lines, 308 stations (391 stops) and 226.9 km (141.0 mi) of rails. Superimposed on this is a 'regional express network', the RER, whose five lines, 257 stops and 587 km (365 mi) of rails connect Paris to more distant parts of the urban area. In addition, the Paris region is served by a light rail network, the tramway. Opened since 1992 for its first line, thirteen lines are currently operational. The network is 164.4 kilometres (102.2 mi) long with 248 stations.\n\n\n\n#### Air[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Louvre received 2,8 million visitors in 2021, up from 2.7 million in 2020,[212] holding its position as first among the most-visited museums. Its treasures include the *Mona Lisa* (*La Joconde*), the *Venus de Milo* statue, and *Liberty Leading the People*. The second-most visited museum in the city in 2021, with 1.5 million visitors, was the Centre Georges Pompidou, also known as Beaubourg, which houses the Musée National d'Art Moderne The third most visited Paris museum in 2021 was the National Museum of Natural History with 1,4 million visitors. It is famous for its dinosaur artefacts, mineral collections and its Gallery of Evolution. It was followed by the Musée d'Orsay, featuring 19th century art and the French Impressionists, which had one million visitors. Paris hosts one of the largest science museums in Europe, the Cité des sciences et de l'industrie, (984,000 visitors in 2020). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter the marshland between the river Seine and its slower 'dead arm' to its north was filled in from around the 10th century,[35] Paris's cultural centre began to move to the Right Bank. In 1137, a new city marketplace (today's Les Halles) replaced the two smaller ones on the Île de la Cité and Place de Grève (Place de l'Hôtel de Ville).[36] The latter location housed the headquarters of Paris's river trade corporation, an organisation that later became, unofficially (although formally in later years), Paris's first municipal government.\n\n\nIn the late 12th century, Philip Augustus extended the Louvre fortress to defend the city against river invasions from the west, gave the city its first walls between 1190 and 1215, rebuilt its bridges to either side of its central island, and paved its main thoroughfares.[37] In 1190, he transformed Paris's former cathedral school into a student-teacher corporation that would become the University of Paris and would draw students from all of Europe.[38][34]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere are 43,800 officers under the prefecture, and a fleet of more than 6,000 vehicles, including police cars, motorcycles, fire trucks, boats and helicopters.[129] The national police has its own special unit for riot control and crowd control and security of public buildings, called the Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité (CRS). Vans of CRS agents are frequently seen in the centre of the city when there are demonstrations and public events. The police are supported by the National Gendarmerie, a branch of the French Armed Forces, though their police operations now are supervised by the Ministry of the Interior.[130]\n\n\nCrime in Paris is similar to that in most large cities. Violent crime is relatively rare in the city centre. Political violence is uncommon, though very large demonstrations may occur in Paris and other French cities simultaneously. These demonstrations, usually managed by a strong police presence, can turn confrontational and escalate into violence.[131]\n\n\n\n## Cityscape[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871), Paris was besieged by the Prussian Army. Following several months of blockade, hunger, and then bombardment by the Prussians, the city was forced to surrender on 28 January 1871. After seizing power in Paris on 28 March, a revolutionary government known as the Paris Commune held power for two months, before being harshly suppressed by the French army during the \"Bloody Week\" at the end of May 1871.[59]\n\n\nIn the late 19th century, Paris hosted two major international expositions: the 1889 Universal Exposition, which featured the new Eiffel Tower, was held to mark the centennial of the French Revolution; and the 1900 Universal Exposition gave Paris the Pont Alexandre III, the Grand Palais, the Petit Palais and the first Paris Métro line.[60] Paris became the laboratory of Naturalism (Émile Zola) and Symbolism (Charles Baudelaire and Paul Verlaine), and of Impressionism in art (Courbet, Manet, Monet, Renoir).[61]\n\n\n\n### 20th and 21st centuries[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The Hôtel-Dieu de Paris is the oldest hospital in the city.\nHealth care and emergency medical service in the City of Paris and its suburbs are provided by the Assistance publique – Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP), a public hospital system that employs more than 90,000 people (including practitioners, support personnel, and administrators) in 44 hospitals.[313] It is the largest hospital system in Europe. It provides health care, teaching, research, prevention, education and emergency medical service in 52 branches of medicine. The hospitals receive more than 5.8 million annual patient visits.[313]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has had its headquarters in Paris since November 1958. Paris is also the home of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).[315] Paris hosts the headquarters of the European Space Agency, the International Energy Agency, European Securities and Markets Authority and the European Banking Authority.\n\n\n\n### Twin towns – sister cities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in France\n\nSince 9 April 1956, Paris is exclusively and reciprocally twinned with:[316][317]\n\n\n\n* ![Italy](image) Rome, 1956\n\n\n*Seule Paris est digne de Rome; seule Rome est digne de Paris.* (in French)\n*Solo Parigi è degna di Roma; solo Roma è degna di Parigi.* (in Italian)\n\"Only Paris is worthy of Rome; only Rome is worthy of Paris.\"[318]\n### Other relationships[edit]\n\n\nParis has agreements of friendship and co-operation with:[316]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)General Charles de Gaulle on the Champs-Élysées celebrating the liberation of Paris, 26 August 1944\nOn 14 June 1940, the German army marched into Paris, which had been declared an \"open city\".[70] On 16–17 July 1942, following German orders, the French police and gendarmes arrested 12,884 Jews, including 4,115 children, and confined them during five days at the *Vel d'Hiv* (*Vélodrome d'Hiver*), from which they were transported by train to the extermination camp at Auschwitz. None of the children came back.[71][72] On 25 August 1944, the city was liberated by the French 2nd Armoured Division and the 4th Infantry Division of the United States Army. General Charles de Gaulle led a huge and emotional crowd down the Champs Élysées towards Notre Dame de Paris, and made a rousing speech from the Hôtel de Ville.[73]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Rue de Rivoli\n![](image)Place des Vosges\nParis is one of the few world capitals that has rarely seen destruction by catastrophe or war. For this, even its earliest history is still visible in its streetmap, and centuries of rulers adding their respective architectural marks on the capital has resulted in an accumulated wealth of history-rich monuments and buildings whose beauty played a large part in giving the city the reputation it has today.[132] At its origin, before the Middle Ages, the city was composed of several islands and sandbanks in a bend of the Seine; of those, two remain today: Île Saint-Louis and the Île de la Cité. A third one is the 1827 artificially created Île aux Cygnes.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nParis has a typical Western European oceanic climate (Köppen: *Cfb*), which is affected by the North Atlantic Current. The overall climate throughout the year is mild and moderately wet.[98] Summer days are usually warm and pleasant with average temperatures between 15 and 25 °C (59 and 77 °F), and a fair amount of sunshine.[99] Each year, however, there are a few days when the temperature rises above 32 °C (90 °F). Longer periods of more intense heat sometimes occur, such as the heat wave of 2003 when temperatures exceeded 30 °C (86 °F) for weeks, reached 40 °C (104 °F) on some days and rarely cooled down at night.[100] Spring and autumn have, on average, mild days and cool nights but are changing and unstable. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Magdalena Frackowiak at Paris Fashion Week (Fall 2011)\nSince the 19th century, Paris has been an international fashion capital, particularly in the domain of haute couture (clothing hand-made to order for private clients).[252] It is home to some of the largest fashion houses in the world, including Dior and Chanel, as well as many other well-known and more contemporary fashion designers, such as Karl Lagerfeld, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Yves Saint Laurent, Givenchy, and Christian Lacroix. Paris Fashion Week, held in January and July in the Carrousel du Louvre among other renowned city locations, is one of the top four events on the international fashion calendar.[253][254] Moreover, Paris is also the home of the world's largest cosmetics company: L'Oréal as well as three of the top five global makers of luxury fashion accessories: Louis Vuitton, Hermés, and Cartier.[255] Most of the major fashion designers have their showrooms along the Avenue Montaigne, between the Champs-Élysées and the Seine.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith 200,000 inhabitants in 1328, Paris, then already the capital of France, was the most populous city of Europe. By comparison, London in 1300 had 80,000 inhabitants. By the early fourteenth century, so much filth had collected inside urban Europe that French and Italian cities were naming streets after human waste. In medieval Paris, several street names were inspired by *merde*, the French word for \"shit\".[39][40]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Hôtel de Sens (c. 15th–16th), former residence of the Archbishop of Sens\nDuring the Hundred Years' War, Paris was occupied by England-friendly Burgundian forces from 1418, before being occupied outright by the English when Henry V of England entered the French capital in 1420;[41] in spite of a 1429 effort by Joan of Arc to liberate the city,[42] it would remain under English occupation until 1436.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy the end of the Western Roman Empire, the town was known as *Parisius*, a Latin name that would later become *Paris* in French.[30] Christianity was introduced in the middle of the 3rd century AD by Saint Denis, the first Bishop of Paris: according to legend, when he refused to renounce his faith before the Roman occupiers, he was beheaded on the hill which became known as *Mons Martyrum* (Latin \"Hill of Martyrs\"), later \"Montmartre\", from where he walked headless to the north of the city; the place where he fell and was buried became an important religious shrine, the Basilica of Saint-Denis, and many French kings are buried there.[31]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2019, Greater Paris had 2,056 hotels, including 94 five-star hotels, with a total of 121,646 rooms.[204] Also in 2019, in addition to the hotels, Greater Paris had 60,000 homes registered with Airbnb.[204] Under French law, renters of these units must pay the Paris tourism tax.

For its leading role in the arts and sciences, as well as its early and extensive system of street lighting, in the 19th century, it became known as the City of Light.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn May 1968, protesting students occupied the Sorbonne and put up barricades in the Latin Quarter. Thousands of Parisian blue-collar workers joined the students, and the movement grew into a two-week general strike. Supporters of the government won the June elections by a large majority. The May 1968 events in France resulted in the break-up of the University of Paris into 13 independent campuses.[76] In 1975, the National Assembly changed the status of Paris to that of other French cities and, on 25 March 1977, Jacques Chirac became the first elected mayor of Paris since 1793.[77] The Tour Maine-Montparnasse, the tallest building in the city at 57 storeys and 210 m (689 ft) high, was built between 1969 and 1973. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)2010 Tour de France, Champs Élysées\nThe final stage of the most famous bicycle racing in the world, Tour de France, always finishes in Paris.

Fortification of the Île de la Cité failed to avert sacking by Vikings in 845, but Paris's strategic importance—with its bridges preventing ships from passing—was established by successful defence in the Siege of Paris (885–886), for which the then Count of Paris (*comte de Paris*), Odo of France, was elected king of West Francia.[33] From the Capetian dynasty that began with the 987 election of Hugh Capet, Count of Paris and Duke of the Franks (*duc des Francs*), as king of a unified West Francia, Paris gradually became the largest and most prosperous city in France.[31]\n\n\n\n### High and Late Middle Ages to Louis XIV[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Paris in the Middle Ages, Paris in the 16th century, and Paris in the 17th century\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ 9.7 Healthcare\n* 10 International relations\n\t+ 10.1 International organisations\n\t+ 10.2 Twin towns – sister cities\n\t+ 10.3 Other relationships\n* 11 See also\n* 12 Notes\n* 13 References\n\t+ 13.1 Citations\n\t+ 13.2 Sources\n* 14 Further reading\n* 15 External links\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nSee Wiktionary for the name of Paris in various languages other than English and French.\n\nThe ancient oppidum that corresponds to the modern city of Paris was first mentioned in the mid-1st century BC by Julius Caesar as *Luteciam Parisiorum* ('Lutetia of the Parisii')*,* and is later attested as *Parision* in the 5th century AD, then as *Paris* in 1265.[17][18] During the Roman period, it was commonly known as *Lutetia* or *Lutecia* in Latin, and as *Leukotekía* in Greek, which is interpreted as either stemming from the Celtic root *\\*lukot-* ('mouse'), or from \\**luto-* ('marsh, swamp').[19][20][18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPaul Delouvrier promised to resolve the Paris-suburbs *mésentente* when he became head of the Paris region in 1961:[143] two of his most ambitious projects for the Region were the construction of five suburban \"villes nouvelles\" (\"new cities\")[144] and the RER commuter train network.[145] Many other suburban residential districts (*grands ensembles*) were built between the 1960s and 1970s to provide a low-cost solution for a rapidly expanding population:[146] These districts were socially mixed at first,[147] but few residents actually owned their homes (the growing economy made these accessible to the middle classes only from the 1970s).[148] Their poor construction quality and their haphazard insertion into existing urban growth contributed to their desertion by those able to move elsewhere and their repopulation by those with more limited possibilities.[148]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe new structure is administered by a Metropolitan Council of 210 members, not directly elected, but chosen by the councils of the member Communes.

It includes the City of Paris, plus the communes of the three departments of the inner suburbs (Hauts-de-Seine, Seine-Saint-Denis and Val-de-Marne), plus seven communes in the outer suburbs, including Argenteuil in Val d'Oise and Paray-Vieille-Poste in Essonne, which were added to include the major airports of Paris. The Metropole covers 814 km2 (314 sq mi) and has a population of 6.945 million persons.[117][118]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)A view of the Seine, the Île de la Cité and a Bateau Mouche\nParis in its early history had only the rivers Seine and Bièvre for water. From 1809, the Canal de l'Ourcq provided Paris with water from less-polluted rivers to the north-east of the capital.[293] From 1857, the civil engineer Eugène Belgrand, under Napoleon III, oversaw the construction of a series of new aqueducts that brought water from locations all around the city to several reservoirs.[294] From then on, the new reservoir system became Paris's principal source of drinking water, and the remains of the old system, pumped into lower levels of the same reservoirs, were from then on used for the cleaning of Paris's streets. This system is still a major part of Paris's water-supply network. Today Paris has more than 2,400 km (1,491 mi) of underground sewers.[295]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThese areas, *quartiers sensibles* (\"sensitive quarters\"), are in northern and eastern Paris, namely around its Goutte d'Or and Belleville neighbourhoods. To the north of the city, they are grouped mainly in the Seine-Saint-Denis department, and to a lesser extreme to the east in the Val-d'Oise department. Other difficult areas are located in the Seine valley, in Évry et Corbeil-Essonnes (Essonne), in Mureaux, Mantes-la-Jolie (Yvelines), and scattered among social housing districts created by Delouvrier's 1961 \"ville nouvelle\" political initiative.[149]\n\n\nThe Paris agglomeration's urban sociology is basically that of 19th-century Paris: the wealthy live in the west and southwest, and the middle-to-working classes are in the north and east. The remaining areas are mostly middle-class dotted with wealthy islands located there due to reasons of historical importance, namely Saint-Maur-des-Fossés to the east and Enghien-les-Bains to the north of Paris.[150]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Blackmore, Ruth; McConnachie, James (2004). *Rough Guide Paris Directions*.

After many modifications, the new area, named the Metropolis of Grand Paris, with a population of 6.7 million, was created on 1 January 2016.[84] In 2011, the City of Paris and the national government approved the plans for the Grand Paris Express, totalling 205 km (127 mi) of automated metro lines to connect Paris, the innermost three departments around Paris, airports and high-speed rail (TGV) stations, at an estimated cost of €35 billion.[85] The system is scheduled to be completed by 2030.[86]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the early 21st century, the population of Paris began to increase slowly again, as more young people moved into the city. It reached 2.25 million in 2011. In March 2001, Bertrand Delanoë became the first socialist mayor. He was re-elected in March 2008.[82] In 2007, in an effort to reduce car traffic, he introduced the Vélib', a system which rents bicycles. Bertrand Delanoë also transformed a section of the highway along the Left Bank of the Seine into an urban promenade and park, the Promenade des Berges de la Seine, which he inaugurated in June 2013.[83]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 1950s and the 1960s, Paris became one front of the Algerian War for independence; in August 1961, the pro-independence FLN targeted and killed 11 Paris policemen, leading to the imposition of a curfew on Muslims of Algeria (who, at that time, were French citizens). On 17 October 1961, an unauthorised but peaceful protest demonstration of Algerians against the curfew led to violent confrontations between the police and demonstrators, in which at least 40 people were killed. The anti-independence Organisation armée secrète (OAS) carried out a series of bombings in Paris throughout 1961 and 1962.[74][75]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nToday, due to Paris's cosmopolitan population, every French regional cuisine and almost every national cuisine in the world can be found there; the city has more than 9,000 restaurants.[247] The Michelin Guide has been a standard guide to French restaurants since 1900, awarding its highest award, three stars, to the best restaurants in France. In 2018, of the 27 Michelin three-star restaurants in France, ten are located in Paris. These include both restaurants which serve classical French cuisine, such as L'Ambroisie in the Place des Vosges, and those which serve non-traditional menus, such as L'Astrance, which combines French and Asian cuisines.

Parisian and Italian musicians who played the accordion adopted the style and established themselves in Auvergnat bars,[232] anParis became a major centre for jazz and still attracts jazz musicians from all around the world to its clubs and cafés.[233]\n\n\nParis is the spiritual home of gypsy jazz in particular, and many of the Parisian jazzmen who developed in the first half of the 20th century began by playing Bal-musette in the city.[232] Django Reinhardt rose to fame in Paris, having moved to the 18th arrondissement in a caravan as a young boy, and performed with violinist Stéphane Grappelli and their Quintette du Hot Club de France in the 1930s and 1940s.[234]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the Paris Region, 590,504 residents were immigrants from Europe, 627,078 were immigrants from the Maghreb, 435,339 from sub-Saharan Africa and Egypt, 69,338 from Turkey, 322,330 from Asia (outside Turkey), 113,363 from the Americas, and 2,261 from the South Pacific.[168]\n\n\nIn 2012, there were 8,810 British citizens and 10,019 United States citizens living in the City of Paris (Ville de Paris) and 20,466 British citizens and 16,408 United States citizens living in the entire Paris Region (Île-de-France).[169][170]\n\n\nIn 2020–2021, about 6 million people, or 41% of the population of the Paris Region, were either immigrants (21%) or had at least one immigrant parent (20%); these figures do not include French people born in Overseas France and their direct descendants.[171]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Religious buildings in Paris\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### 18th and 19th centuries[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Paris in the 18th century, Paris during the Second Empire, and Haussmann's renovation of Paris\n\nParis grew in population from about 400,000 in 1640, to 650,000 in 1780.[49] A new boulevard named the Champs-Élysées extended the city west to Étoile,[50] while the working-class neighbourhood of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine on the eastern side of the city grew increasingly crowded with poor migrant workers from other regions of France.[51]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Gare du Nord railway station is the busiest in Europe.\nParis is a major rail, highway, and air transport hub. Île-de-France Mobilités (IDFM), formerly the Syndicat des transports d'Île-de-France (STIF) and before that the Syndicat des transports parisiens (STP), oversees the transit network in the region.[278] The syndicate coordinates public transport and contracts it out to the RATP (operating 347 bus lines, the Métro, eight tramway lines, and sections of the RER), the SNCF (operating suburban rails, one tramway line and the other sections of the RER) and the Optile consortium of private operators managing 1,176 bus lines.[279]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSee also: Paris in the Belle Époque, Paris during the First World War, Paris between the Wars (1919–1939), Paris in World War II, and History of Paris (1946–2000)\n\nBy 1901, the population of Paris had grown to about 2,715,000.[62] At the beginning of the century, artists from around the world including Pablo Picasso, Modigliani, and Henri Matisse made Paris their home. It was the birthplace of Fauvism, Cubism and abstract art,[63][64] and authors such as Marcel Proust were exploring new approaches to literature.[65]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAside from the 20th-century addition of the Bois de Boulogne, the Bois de Vincennes and the Paris heliport, Paris's administrative limits have remained unchanged since 1860. A greater administrative Seine department had been governing Paris and its suburbs since its creation in 1790, but the rising suburban population had made it difficult to maintain as a unique entity. To address this problem, the parent \"District de la région parisienne\" ('district of the Paris region') was reorganised into several new departments from 1968: Paris became a department in itself, and the administration of its suburbs was divided between the three new departments surrounding it. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n160. **^** Institut National de la Statistique et des Études Économiques. \"Population en historique depuis 1968: Commune de Paris (75056)\" (in French).

The number of deputy mayors in each arrondissement varies depending upon its population. As of 1996, there were a total of 20 arrondissement mayors and 120 deputy mayors.[109] The creation of Paris Centre, a unified administrative division with a single mayor covering the first four arrondissements, took effect with the said 2020 election; the other 16 arrondissements continue to have their own mayors.[115]\n\n\n\n### Métropole du Grand Paris[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Savigny-le-Temple\n* Stains\n* Sucy-en-Brie\n* Suresnes\n* Taverny\n* Thiais\n* Trappes\n* Tremblay-en-France\n* Les Ulis\n* Vanves\n* Vigneux-sur-Seine\n* Villemomble\n* Villeneuve-Saint-Georges\n* Villeparisis\n* Villepinte\n* Villiers-le-Bel\n* Villiers-sur-Marne\n* Vincennes\n* Viry-Châtillon\n* Yerres\n |\n| Population under 25,000 | * *1,792 other communes*\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nAdministrative division of Île-de-France (on 1 January 2022)Prefecture: Paris\n |\n| --- |\n| Essonne (91) | Prefecture: Évry-Courcouronnes\n* Three arrondissements\n* 21 cantons\n* 194 communes\n* 10 legislative constituencies\n* 10 intercommunalities\n |\n| Hauts-de-Seine (92) | Prefecture: Nanterre\n- Three arrondissements\n\n- 23 cantons\n\n- 36 communes\n\n- 13 legislative constituencies\n\n- 4 EPTs\n |\n| Paris (75) | Prefecture: Paris\n- One departmental arrondissement\n\n- 1 commune\n\n- 20 municipal arrondissements\n\n- 80 administrative quarters\n\n- 18 legislative constituencies\n\n- 1 intercommunality\n |\n| Seine-et-Marne (77) | Prefecture: Melun\n- Five arrondissements\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Satellite image of Paris, captured by ESA's Sentinel-2 mission\nParis is located in northern central France, in a north-bending arc of the river Seine whose crest includes two islands, the Île Saint-Louis and the larger Île de la Cité, which form the oldest part of the city.

This king made several improvements to the capital during his reign: he completed the construction of Paris's first uncovered, sidewalk-lined bridge, the Pont Neuf, built a Louvre extension connecting it to the Tuileries Palace, and created the first Paris residential square, the Place Royale, now Place des Vosges. In spite of Henry IV's efforts to improve city circulation, the narrowness of Paris's streets was a contributing factor in his assassination near Les Halles marketplace in 1610.[45]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Administrative structures\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\n![](image) Communes in the Paris metropolitan area\n |\n| --- |\n| Population over 2 million | * Paris\n |\n| Population over 100,000 | * Argenteuil\n* Boulogne-Billancourt\n* Montreuil\n* Saint-Denis\n |\n| Population over 75,000 | * Asnières-sur-Seine\n* Aubervilliers\n* Aulnay-sous-Bois\n* Champigny-sur-Marne\n* Colombes\n* Courbevoie\n* Créteil\n* Nanterre\n* Rueil-Malmaison\n* Versailles\n* Vitry-sur-Seine\n |\n| Population over 50,000 | * Antony\n* Le Blanc-Mesnil\n* Bobigny\n* Bondy\n* Cergy\n* Chelles\n* Clamart\n* Clichy\n* Corbeil-Essonnes\n* Drancy\n* Épinay-sur-Seine\n* Évry-Courcouronnes\n* Fontenay-sous-Bois\n* Issy-les-Moulineaux\n* Ivry-sur-Seine\n* Levallois-Perret\n* Maisons-Alfort\n* Massy\n* Meaux\n* Neuilly-sur-Seine\n* Noisy-le-Grand\n* Pantin\n* Saint-Maur-des-Fossés\n* Saint-Ouen-sur-Seine\n* Sarcelles\n* Sartrouville\n* Sevran\n* Villejuif\n |\n| Population over 25,000 | * Alfortville\n* Athis-Mons\n* Bagneux\n* Bagnolet\n* Bezons\n* Bois-Colombes\n* Brétigny-sur-Orge\n* Brunoy\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 2017 worldwide cost of living survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, based on a survey made in September 2016, Paris ranked as the seventh most expensive city in the world, and the second most expensive in Europe, after Zurich.[195] In 2018, Paris was the most expensive city in the world with Singapore and Hong Kong.[196] Station F is a business incubator for startups, noted as the world's largest startup facility.[197]\n\n\n\n### Employment and income[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSurprisingly warm or cool weather occurs frequently in both seasons.[101] In winter, sunshine is scarce; days are cool, and nights are cold but generally above freezing with low temperatures around 3 °C (37 °F).[102] Light night frosts are however quite common, but the temperature seldom dips below −5 °C (23 °F). The city sometimes sees light snow or flurries with or without accumulation.[103]\n\n\nParis has an average annual precipitation of 641 mm (25.2 in), and experiences light rainfall distributed evenly throughout the year. However, the city is known for intermittent, abrupt, heavy showers. The highest recorded temperature was 42.6 °C (108.7 °F) on 25 July 2019,[104] and the lowest was −23.9 °C (−11.0 °F) on 10 December 1879.[105]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLouis XVI and the royal family were brought to Paris and incarcerated in the Tuileries Palace. In 1793, as the revolution turned increasingly radical, the king, queen and mayor were beheaded by guillotine in the Reign of Terror, along with more than 16,000 others throughout France.[54] The property of the aristocracy and the church was nationalised, and the city's churches were closed, sold or demolished.[55] A succession of revolutionary factions ruled Paris until 9 November 1799 (*coup d'état du 18 brumaire*), when Napoleon Bonaparte seized power as First Consul.[56]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Front de Seine development along the river Seine\nThe most expensive residential street in Paris in 2018 by average price per square metre was Avenue Montaigne, at 22,372 euros per square metre.[137] The total number of residences in the City of Paris in 2011 was 1,356,074, up from a former high of 1,334,815 in 2006. Among these, 1,165,541 (85.9 percent) were main residences, 91,835 (6.8 percent) were secondary residences, and the remaining 7.3 percent were empty (down from 9.2 percent in 2006).[138]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Sorbonne University\nParis is the département with the highest proportion of highly educated people. In 2009, around 40 percent of Parisians held a *licence*-level diploma or higher, the highest proportion in France,[309] while 13 percent have no diploma, the third-lowest percentage in France. Education in Paris and the Île-de-France region employs approximately 330,000 people, 170,000 of whom are teachers and professors teaching approximately 2.9 million students in around 9,000 primary, secondary, and higher education schools and institutions.[310]\n\n\nThe University of Paris, founded in the 12th century, is often called the Sorbonne after one of its original medieval colleges. It was broken up into thirteen autonomous universities in 1970, following the student demonstrations in 1968. Most of the campuses today are in the Latin Quarter where the old university was located, while others are scattered around the city and the suburbs.[311]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the First World War, Paris sometimes found itself on the front line; 600 to 1,000 Paris taxis played a small but highly important symbolic role in transporting 6,000 soldiers to the front line at the First Battle of the Marne. The city was also bombed by Zeppelins and shelled by German long-range guns.[66] In the years after the war, known as *Les Années Folles*, Paris continued to be a mecca for writers, musicians and artists from around the world, including Ernest Hemingway, Igor Stravinsky, James Joyce, Josephine Baker, Eva Kotchever, Henry Miller, Anaïs Nin, Sidney Bechet[67] and Salvador Dalí.[68]\n\n\nIn the years after the peace conference, the city was also home to growing numbers of students and activists from French colonies and other Asian and African countries, who later became leaders of their countries, such as Ho Chi Minh, Zhou Enlai and Léopold Sédar Senghor.[69]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The Élysée Palace, official residence of the President of France\nAs the capital of France, Paris is the seat of France's national government. For the executive, the two chief officers each have their own official residences, which also serve as their offices. The President of the French Republic resides at the Élysée Palace,[121] while the Prime Minister's seat is at the Hôtel Matignon.[122][123] Government ministries are located in various parts of the city, many near the Hôtel Matignon.[124]\n\n\nBoth houses of the French Parliament are located on the Rive Gauche. The upper house, the Senate, meets in the Palais du Luxembourg, while the more important lower house, the National Assembly, meets in the Palais Bourbon. The President of the Senate, the second-highest public official in France (the President of the Republic being the sole superior), resides in the Petit Luxembourg, a smaller palace annexe to the Palais du Luxembourg.[125]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Paris Region had 5.4 million salaried employees in 2010, of whom 2.2 million were concentrated in 39 *pôles d'emplois* or business districts. The largest of these, in terms of number of employees, is known in French as the QCA, or *quartier central des affaires*; in 2010, it was the workplace of 500,000 salaried employees, about 30 percent of the salaried employees in Paris and 10 percent of those in the Île-de-France. The largest sectors of activity in the central business district were finance and insurance (16 percent of employees in the district) and business services (15 percent). The district also includes a large concentration of department stores, shopping areas, hotels and restaurants, as well a government offices and ministries.[186] The second-largest business district in terms of employment is La Défense, just west of the city. In 2010, it was the workplace of 144,600 employees, of whom 38 percent worked in finance and insurance, 16 percent in business support services. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe military history of France is presented by displays at the Musée de l'Armée at Les Invalides. In addition to the national museums, run by the Ministry of Culture, the City of Paris operates 14 museums, including the Carnavalet Museum on the history of Paris, Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, Palais de Tokyo, the House of Victor Hugo, the House of Balzac and the Catacombs of Paris.[214] There are also notable private museums. The Contemporary Art museum of the Louis Vuitton Foundation, designed by architect Frank Gehry, opened in October 2014 in the Bois de Boulogne.\n\n\n\n### Theatre[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n152. **^** INSEE. \"IMG1B - Population immigrée par sexe, âge et pays de naissance en 2019 - Région d'Île-de-France (11)\" (in French).

Between the wars it was the home of many important expatriate writers, including Ernest Hemingway, Samuel Beckett, Miguel Ángel Asturias, Alejo Carpentier and, Arturo Uslar Pietri. The winner of the 2014 Nobel Prize in Literature, Patrick Modiano, based most of his literary work on the depiction of the city during World War II and the 1960s–1970s.[225]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>"}

The New York Times has a circulation of 9,126,330 news subscribers, of which 8,830,000 are digital-only and 912,330 are print subscribers. The Wall Street Journal has a circulation of 3,779,650 news subscribers, of which 3,170,000 are digital-only and 609,650 are print subscribers.\n\nThe Editors-in-Chief of these newspapers are Joseph Kahn for The New York Times and Emma Tucker for The Wall Street Journal. The Managing Editors are Marc Lacey and Carolyn Ryan for The New York Times and Liz Harris for The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe New York Times is known for its liberal bias in news coverage, while The Wall Street Journal is known for its conservative bias, particularly in its editorial pages. However, both newspapers are regarded as newspapers of record and have won numerous Pulitzer Prizes for their journalism.\n\nThe New York Times has won 132 Pulitzer Prizes, the most of any newspaper, and has long been regarded as a national \"newspaper of record.\" The Wall Street Journal has won 39 Pulitzer Prizes and is highly respected for its business and financial news coverage.\n\nThe New York Times has faced criticism for its coverage of the Hillary Clinton emails controversy during the 2016 presidential election, while The Wall Street Journal has been criticized for its editorial board's calls for Special Counsel Robert Mueller to resign during the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 elections.\n\nBoth newspapers have made significant contributions to investigative journalism, with The New York Times known for its coverage of the Harvey Weinstein scandal and The Wall Street Journal known for its investigation into Theranos and the 1MDB scandal involving Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak.\n\nThe New York Times has been criticized for its handling of transgender rights and healthcare coverage, while The Wall Street Journal has been criticized for its coverage of climate change and its editorial board's stance on various political issues.\n\nIn summary, while both newspapers have their biases and have faced criticisms, they remain influential and widely read sources of news in the United States."}

{"id":"7fdef69fd2faae8e","answer":"The jaguar is a large cat species native to the Americas. It is the third-largest cat in the world and the largest in the Americas. The jaguar is a solitary, stalk-and-ambush apex predator. It is sexually dimorphic, with males being larger than females. The jaguar has a powerful bite force, allowing it to pierce the carapaces of turtles and tortoises. It is an excellent swimmer and climber. The jaguar is a keystone species, playing an important role in stabilizing ecosystems and in regulating prey populations. The jaguar is threatened by habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, poaching for trade with its body parts and killings in human-wildlife conflict situations, particularly with ranchers in Central and South America. It has been listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List since 2002. The wild population is thought to have declined since the late 1990s. Priority areas for jaguar conservation comprise 51 Jaguar Conservation Units (JCUs), defined as large areas inhabited by at least 50 breeding individuals and range in size from 566 to 67,598\\u00a0km2 (219 to 26,100\\u00a0sq\\u00a0mi); 51 JCUs were designated in 36 geographic regions including: Mexico, Central America, and South America."}

It is about 446 miles (718\\u00a0km) long and flows generally southward through the U.S. states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, and Louisiana. The river's source is Lake Itasca in northern Minnesota. The upper Mississippi River (above Saint Anthony Falls) is navigable by large barges, although the size of the barges has been reduced over time. The river is also navigable from Minneapolis to Saint Louis, but this stretch of the river is maintained at a minimum depth of 9 feet (2.7\\u00a0m) for barge traffic.

Monroe resigned as Secretary of State on October 1 but no successor was ever appointed, so he handled both offices from October 1, 1814 to February 28, 1815. As Secretary of War, Monroe formulated plans to invade Canada a second time to win the War of 1812, but a peace treaty was ratified in February 1815, before any U.S. military forced moved north. Monroe then resigned as Secretary of War and was formally re-appointed Secretary of State, where he served until March 4, 1817, when he succeeded James Madison to become the nation's fifth President of the United States.\\n\\n\\n\\n## First Lady of the United States[edit]\\n\\n\\n</fragment>\\n<fragment>\\nAlthough Elizabeth Monroe regained a measure of respect and admiration during her husband's second term, she compared poorly to her predecessor, Dolley Madison, who had captivated Washington society, setting a standard by which future First Ladies were measured.[13] Furthermore, Elizabeth and her eldest daughter may have sought to make access to the White House more socially exclusive, reflecting French practices, which were barely tolerated given American democratic values, although President Monroe's term was also known for good feelings and relations. Still, Elizabeth had made such an impression upon General Andrew Jackson that her husband always mentioned her to him in their correspondence. Elizabeth also drew favorable reviews as the couple briefly hosted General Lafayette during his return tour through America.[11] During Elizabeth's illnesses, some of the social duties were carried out by her daughters, as discussed below. \\n</fragment>\\n<fragment>\\n* **Elizabeth (\\\"Eliza\\\") Kortright Monroe Hay** (1786\\u2013January 27, 1840): Born in Virginia in December, 1786,[18] Eliza was educated at the school of Madame Jeanne Campan in Paris, when her father served as United States Ambassador to France. Eliza appeared to many a haughty, pompous socialite, quick to remind others of her good breeding and lofty station. In late September or early October 1808 she married George Hay,[19][*failed verification*] a prominent Virginia attorney who had served as prosecutor in the trial of Aaron Burr and later U.S. District Judge. Their daughter, Hortense, was named in honor of her childhood friend and classmate, Hortense de Beauharnais, step-daughter of Napoleon. During her father's presidency, Eliza alienated most of Washington society for her refusal to call on wives of the diplomatic corps, as was the custom, and caused another social furor in closing her sister's wedding to all but family and friends. \\n</fragment>\\n<fragment>\\n\\nElizabeth began her tenure as First Lady on March 4, 1817, when her husband commenced his first term as the fifth president of the United States. However, the White House was still under reconstruction, so Elizabeth hosted the inaugural ball at their private residence on I Street, and part of the time the First Family lived in the Octagon House.[11] Since all the White House furnishings had been destroyed, the Monroes brought some from their private residences. Her husband was re-elected to a second term in office in 1820, and Elizabeth attended the inaugural ball held in Brown's Hotel.

Parish records indicate that Maria was born on April 8.[24] The following year, while still an infant, Maria accompanied her parents to London, when James Monroe became Ambassador from the United States to the Court of St. James. Upon the family's return to the United States, Maria finished school in Philadelphia. On March 9, 1820, she married her first cousin, Samuel L. Gouverneur, in the first wedding of a president's child at the White House.[25] Many in Washington criticized the Monroes for keeping the wedding private; just 42 members of the family and close friends were invited. Friction between Maria's husband and her outspoken sister strained family relations thereafter. The Gouverneurs moved to New York City. Former President Monroe, upon losing his wife in 1830, moved in with them. \\n</fragment>\\n<fragment>\\n\\n| * v\\n* t\\n* e\\nFirst ladies of the United States\\n |\\n| --- |\\n| * Martha Washington\\n* Abigail Adams\\n* Martha Jefferson Randolph\\n* Dolley Madison\\n* Elizabeth Monroe\\n* Louisa Adams\\n* Emily Donelson\\n* Sarah Jackson\\n* Angelica Van Buren\\n* Anna Harrison\\n* Jane Harrison\\n* Letitia Tyler\\n* Priscilla Tyler\\n* Julia Tyler\\n* Sarah Polk\\n* Margaret Taylor\\n* Abigail Fillmore\\n* Jane Pierce\\n* Harriet Lane\\n* Mary Todd Lincoln\\n* Eliza Johnson\\n* Julia Grant\\n* Lucy Hayes\\n* Lucretia Garfield\\n* Mary McElroy\\n* Rose Cleveland\\n* Frances Cleveland\\n* Caroline Harrison\\n* Mary Harrison\\n* Frances Cleveland\\n* Ida McKinley\\n* Edith Roosevelt\\n* Helen Taft\\n* Ellen Wilson\\n* Margaret Wilson\\n* Edith Wilson\\n* Florence Harding\\n* Grace Coolidge\\n* Lou Hoover\\n* Eleanor Roosevelt\\n* Bess Truman\\n* Mamie Eisenhower\\n* Jacqueline Kennedy\\n* Lady Bird Johnson\\n* Pat"}

It is the highest peak on the continent, with a summit elevation of 5,895 metres (19,341 feet). The mountain is part of Kilimanjaro National Park and is a major climbing destination. It is composed of three volcanic cones: Kibo, Mawenzi, and Shira. Kibo is the highest peak and is dormant, while Mawenzi and Shira are extinct. The mountain is known for its diminishing glaciers and ice fields, which have been used for research into past climate change.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Contents\\n\\n* 1 Geography\\n* 2 Geology\\n* 3 Climate and glaciers\\n* 4 History\\n* 5 Climbing\\n* 6 See also\\n* 7 References\\n* 8 External links\\n\\n## Geography[edit]\\n\\n\\n</fragment>\\n<fragment>\\n\\nMount Kilimanjaro is located in northeastern Tanzania, near the border with Kenya. It is part of the Eastern Rift Valley and is about 330 kilometres (205 miles) south of the equator. The mountain is surrounded by forest and farmland, with coffee and bananas being the main crops grown in the area. The lower slopes of the mountain are home to the Chagga people, while the upper slopes are uninhabited.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Geology[edit]\\n\\n\\n</fragment>\\n<fragment>\\n\\nMount Kilimanjaro is a large stratovolcano composed of lava, tuffs, and pyroclastic rocks. It is about 1 million years old and was formed by the coalescence of two older volcanoes, Shira and Mawenzi. The mountain is considered dormant, with the most recent eruption occurring about 200,000 years ago. The summit of the mountain is a crater about 1.9 kilometres (1.2 miles) wide and 300 metres (980 feet) deep.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Climate and glaciers[edit]\\n\\n\\n</fragment>\\n<fragment>\\n\\nThe climate of Mount Kilimanjaro is influenced by its height and location near the equator. The mountain has a tropical climate, with two rainy seasons. The lower slopes of the mountain receive more rainfall than the upper slopes, which are drier and cooler. The temperature at the summit can drop to as low as -15\\u00a0\\u00b0C (5\\u00a0\\u00b0F), and the mountain is often covered in snow and ice.\\n\\n\\nThe glaciers on Mount Kilimanjaro have been retreating for over a century, and are expected to disappear completely by 2040. The retreat of the glaciers is due to a combination of factors, including increased temperature, decreased humidity, and changes in wind patterns. The glaciers are also thinning, which makes them more susceptible to melting.\\n\\n\\n\\n## History[edit]\\n\\n\\n</fragment>\\n<fragment>\\n\\nThe first recorded ascent of Mount Kilimanjaro was in 1889 by Hans Meyer and Ludwig Purtscheller. They reached the summit on October 6, 1889, and named it Kaiser-Wilhelm-Spitze. The mountain was later renamed Uhuru Peak, meaning \\\"Freedom Peak\\\" in Kiswahili, to mark Tanzania's independence from British rule in 1961.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Climbing[edit]\\n\\n\\n</fragment>\\n<fragment>\\n\\nMount Kilimanjaro is a popular climbing destination, with thousands of people attempting to reach the summit each year. The most common route is the Marangu Route, which takes about 5 to 7 days to complete. The route passes through rainforest, moorland, and alpine meadows before reaching the base camp at about 3,000 metres (9,800 feet). From there, climbers ascend to the summit over a period of 4 to 6 days, depending on their pace and the weather conditions.\\n\\n\\nThe summit of Mount Kilimanjaro is known as Uhuru Peak, and is the highest point in Africa. The view from the summit is spectacular, with glaciers and ice fields stretching out in all directions. The descent from the summit is steep and can be dangerous, with many climbers suffering from altitude sickness.\\n\\n\\n\\n## See also[edit]\\n\\n\\n* ![icon](image)Mountains portal\\n* ![flag](image)Tanzania portal\\n* ![map](image)Africa portal\\n* ![icon](image)Climbing portal\\n* ![icon](image)Geography portal\\n* ![icon](image)Seven Summits\\n* ![icon](image)Volcanoes\\n* ![icon](image)Glaciers\\n* ![icon](image)Mountaineering\\n* ![icon](image)Tanzania\\n* ![icon](image)Kilimanjaro National Park\\n* ![icon](image)Africa\\n* ![icon](image)Tanzania\\n* ![icon](image)Mount Kilimanjaro\\n* ![icon](image)Uhuru Peak\\n* ![icon](image)Kibo\\n* ![icon](image)Mawenzi\\n* ![icon](image)Shira\\n* ![icon](image)Glaciers of Kilimanjaro\\n* ![icon](image)Climate of Kilimanjaro\\n* ![icon](image)Geology of Kilimanjaro\\n* ![icon](image)History of Kilimanjaro\\n* ![icon](image)Climbing Kilimanjaro\\n* ![icon](image)Kilimanjaro in popular culture\\n* ![icon](image)Kilimanjaro in literature\\n* ![icon](image)Kilimanjaro in film\\n* ![icon](image)Kilimanjaro in music\\n* ![icon](image)Kilimanjaro in video games\\n* ![icon](image)Kilimanjaro in board games\\n* ![icon](image)Kilimanjaro in comics\\n* ![icon](image)Kilimanjaro in anime and manga\\n* ![icon](image)Kilimanjaro in mythology\\n* ![icon](image)Kilimanjaro in folklore\\n* ![icon](image)Kilimanjaro in philately\\n* ![icon](image)Kilimanjaro in numismatics\\n* ![icon](image)Kilimanjaro in astrology\\n* ![icon](image)Kilimanjaro in divination\\n* ![icon](image)Kilimanjaro in Wicca\\n* ![icon](image)Kilimanjaro in other\\n\\n\\n## References[edit]\\n\\n\\n</fragment>\\n<fragment>\\n\\n1. **^** \\\"Mount Kilimanjaro\\\". *Encyclop\\u00e6dia Britannica*.

It was known by the Tewa inhabitants as *Ogh\\u00e1 P\\u00f2ogeh Owingeh* (\\u00e2White Shell Water Place\\u00e2).[13] The Tanoan and other Pueblo people settled along the Rio Grande in the 14th century. A Tewa town that grew at the foot of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains was later called *Caypa* by the Tewa, and this name was eventually transferred to Santa Fe, New Mexico. The Tewa found the area good for hunting and gathering. There was a network of early communities that stretched across the present-day Northern New Mexico and narrowed into the upper Rio Grande Valley. One of the earliest known settlements in what today is downtown Santa Fe came sometime after 900 CE. A group of native Tewa built a cluster of homes that centered around the site of today's Plaza and spread for half a mile to the south and east. The village was called *Ogapoge* until the 1600s, when Santa Fe became the first capital city in what is the modern United States of America, though after February 1610 Santa Fe would remain the provincial seat of the Kingdom of New Mexico. When the area was still under Spanish rule, the city was founded by colonial governor Pedro de Peralta, prior to the city's existence there was no palatable farming land to grow crops, so early settlers were forced to trade with the nomadic indigenous peoples who visited the area annually to sell and or exchange food and other goods.\\n\\n\\n</fragment>\\n<fragment>\\n\\nThe Palace of the Governors in Santa Fe, New Mexico, is the oldest continuously occupied public building in the United States.

Ozone is produced in the upper atmosphere by the action of ultraviolet radiation on molecular oxygen. Oxygen is also present in the atmosphere as water vapor (H2O), which is a greenhouse gas and a major component of the Earth's hydrosphere. Oxygen is also present in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide (CO2), which is a greenhouse gas and a major component of the Earth's carbon cycle.\\n\\n\\n</fragment>\\n<fragment>\\n\\nOxygen is a highly reactive element and is a strong oxidizing agent. It readily combines with most elements to form oxides. Oxygen is used in many industrial processes, including steelmaking, plastics manufacturing, and rocket propulsion. It is also used in water treatment and in breathing systems for medical, underwater, and high-altitude applications. Oxygen is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas at standard temperature and pressure. It is slightly denser than air and is a strong oxidizing agent.
